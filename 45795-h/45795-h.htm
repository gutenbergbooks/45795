<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE present volume is a translation from the
Danish language of one of Rev. Mr. Gravengaard's
books which in its original form has attained
a success among Danes in the United States
and Americans of Danish descent which is quite unprecedented
in the annals of Danish immigrant literature,
secular and religious. The book has passed
through two large editions and has even found wide
reading in far-off Denmark.</div>

<p>The work of rendering this volume into English
has been a source of unlimited joy because of the
clarity of the author's message; the form in which
he has clothed his thoughts, and the immediate
humanistic touch evident from beginning to end.
It is the hope of the translator that an equal measure
of satisfaction and delight may accrue to the
public who now for the first time may enjoy the
opportunity of becoming familiar with Mr. Gravengaard's
writings in the language of the United
States.</p>

<h2>A CHRISTMAS GIFT</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHRISTMAS THOUGHTS</h2>


<div class='center'><br />1. <i>The Christmas Angel's: Dost thou remember?</i></div>

<div class='drop-cap'>I &nbsp; WAS sitting in my study. Darkness was gathering,
and it was Christmas Eve. Then it was
as though a kind and soothing voice whispered into
my ear: Dost thou remember Christmas Eve at
home?</div>

<p>Do I?&mdash;Indeed, I remember it as it were but
yesterday. I remember so plainly how we, all finely
dressed, gathered at the long table. There father
was sitting at one end reading aloud from the old
hymn book while we all listened, our hands folded.</p>

<p>At the other end of the table grandmother was
sitting, and I next to her, for I was "Grandma's
boy." The old brass spectacles were sitting astride
the very tip of her nose so that I could not quite
grasp whether she peered through them or merely
glanced above them.</p>

<p>When father had finished reading, grandmother
spoke up&mdash;she wanted us to sing now this Christmas
carol, now that; she had sung on Christmas
Eve for so many, many years that she could lead us
in singing them. Her voice&mdash;well, it was old, for
she was past eighty, but if you say it wasn't fine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
then you surely are no good as a judge of grandmother's
voice.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>Mother&mdash;do I remember her? Indeed, I never
forget her. Gentle and quiet she sat at the table,
slightly pale, her cheeks somewhat haggard. Her
mother-eye wandered from one to the other, resting
on each of us with a wealth of love. It was a
strange look that came from those eyes surrounded
by dark edges&mdash;it was so filled with love and wistfulness.</p>

<p>Then came that Christmas when her chair stood
vacant. O, yes, I remember her so plainly. It was
quite near Christmas when she closed her eyes, and
her last words to us were: "<i>Follow Jesus!</i>"</p>

<p>Yes, I remember it all, but&mdash;O, wait just a little&mdash;it
was only that&mdash;if tonight you visit those dear
ones at home, tell them then that I remember it all.
And tell them that we also&mdash;despite the struggle
for money and the increasing lack of veneration for
ancient Christian festivals&mdash;tell them that we also
celebrate Christmas both in our home and in the
church.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>Thus I sent my Christmas greetings carried on
the wings of the angel.</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>Room for Jesus</i>

<br />(<span class="smcap">Luc.</span> 2, 7)</div>

<p>"There was no room in the inn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>No, neither was there room in the golden
regal halls in Jerusalem nor in the palace of the
high priest. Therefore the angels&mdash;those heavenly
messengers&mdash;came to neither the inn nor Jerusalem.
It is not with the angels as with the invader's
hordes in Belgium&mdash;they do not intrude upon foreign
soil, sword in hand. They are the messengers
of peace, and visit only those who have room for
Jesus.</p>

<p>And here we behold first of all the shepherds on
the field near Bethlehem. In their hearts there
was <i>room</i> for Jesus; the sweet music from Heaven
above found the <i>way open</i> to these men.</p>

<p>They had been sitting out there watching how old
and young flocked to the City of David to register
on the tax list. It must have been a sore trial for
them to think how God's people had come under a
foreign yoke: Wasn't, then, all hope dead? Were
not the living conditions of Israel so desperate; the
people themselves so harassed that it must needs be
impossible for God to fulfill His promises from the
ancient days of yore? They bent their heads, sighing
heavily.</p>

<p>But the sigh soared upward.</p>

<p>Thus they sat in the stillness of the night, bent
under the sufferings of the age, as in former days
Israel sat at the rivers of Babylon: Nobody dared
play the harp! Nay&mdash;who would really be able
to let the harp chords burst out in a song of joy&mdash;under
<i>such conditions</i>? That would have been almost
levity.</p>

<p>But the sigh had ascended up high, and the
Angel stood before them saying: I can! I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
make the harp play a song of joy. I come from
the mansions of Heaven with a cheering message:
"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of
great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto
you is born this day, in the City of David, a
Saviour, which is Christ the Lord&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then the first of all jubilant Christmas hymns
was borne upon the pure lips of angels and carried
all over the earth. That was the sweet <i>music from
Heaven</i> which shall never die.</p>

<p>It shall sound for all those who sit in misery, or
who sigh because of their poverty&mdash;for those who
think that their life has become so turned upside
down that nothing can ever be righted again&mdash;for
those who sigh: No, under such circumstances
we cannot sing the cheery songs. To all these it
shall be said: <i>It is not impossible, at all!</i> It
doesn't matter so much how your living conditions
are, difficult or easy, dark or bright, nor how disrupted
your life may be. What does matter, is
whether or not you have room for Jesus.</p>

<p>You say: Alas&mdash;if He only would, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Remember, my dear, that at one time He was
satisfied with a <i>manger</i> and with a <i>cross</i>. While on
the cross He said to a miserable malefactor: "To-day
shalt thou be with me in Paradise." And on
another occasion He said to a woman taken in adultery:
"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no
more!"</p>

<p><i>Fear not!</i></p>

<p>That was the first tone in the music from Heaven,
and it was meant for <i>you</i>, also. Indeed, He will
abide with you, too, when you will give Him room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in your heart. Also you He will save into His
heavenly realm. But, then tell me: Isn't there,
even considering your wants and circumstances,
every reason why you should sing a Christmas
hymn with joy in your heart?</p>

<p>It was not levity that made the angels sing
jubilantly that Christmas Eve: <i>They had beheld
that which had been prepared for mankind through
the love of God our Father</i>. Therefore, they could
sing the jubilant songs.</p>

<p>So, try then to look beyond all the <i>despair</i> down
here. Try to raise your eyes to the bright Heavens&mdash;to
that which has been prepared for you through
the love of God our Father. If it does happen,
nevertheless, that once in a while you bend your
head <i>downward</i>, then let the sigh soar <i>upward</i>&mdash;for
it may thus happen that angels will visit you.</p>

<p>Therefore it shall be proclaimed loudly by the
church of Jesus Christ&mdash;from the city on the mountain
throughout all the lands of the earth&mdash;to all
those who have room for Jesus: <i>Fear not! It is
never so dark in your life that there is no room for
the joyful songs of Christmas!</i></p>


<div class='center'><br />3. <i>Well-Springs of Joy</i></div>

<p>Well-springs of joy!</p>

<p>It does sound a bit strange that <i>a babe on
the knee of a virgin</i> might be the well-spring of
joy. Ordinarily, it is a well-spring of worry and
tears when a virgin sits with her babe on her knee&mdash;worry
and tears for herself and for those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
related to her. But here we behold a virgin who
herself has sung the joyful hymn of praise because
she had been found deserving of such grace.</p>

<p>Well-springs of joy it was to Mary and to the
aged Elizabeth from the very beginning&mdash;and now
the Christmas Angel announces that it is "for all the
people."</p>

<p>But, someone may say to us: Yes, we know that
the <i>shepherds</i> were happy and that joy reigned in
the <i>inn</i>, and we also realize that you speak of
Christmas joy, etc., but when you say that this
story about the Child in the Manger is a well-spring
of joy&mdash;then, really, you go a little bit too
far, and such exaggerations hurt your own cause.
It isn't sensible to make it out quite as strong as
that. Behold that highly praised Child Jesus nailed
to the cross as a condemned criminal, His mother
standing at the foot of the cross&mdash;and then tell us:
Isn't it true that this Child, like so many, many
others, made joy change into sorrow? Wouldn't
any mother's heart break when she had to witness
her son die the death of a condemned criminal?
Even though no sin was found in Him, then you
must admit that in this position he was a well of
sorrow and weeping rather than of joy.</p>

<p>We answer: We know very well that His
mother and His disciples mourned and wept&mdash;they
could not do otherwise in that hour. But the
<i>well-spring</i> of this sorrow and weeping was not in
the crucified Christ. Even in this hour He is the
well-spring of joy, for then He nailed our debt
of sin to the cross. Then He redeemed us from
the power of sin and death and the devil. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for our sake that He allowed Himself to be nailed
fast onto the cross. It was thus magnificently revealed
here that the Child praised while sitting on
the virgin's knee, had proved to be our faithful
friend in life and death, when He became a man.
Therefore, He is, also, in this the darkest hour of
His earthly life, a well-spring of joy, and if we
are to weep when we gather about the Christmas
Child as the Crucified One in the church of the
Lord&mdash;then it shall be out of the joy of our
hearts.</p>

<p>The Christmas Child is the only one, born of
woman, of whom it can be said that He has been a
well-spring of joy. And that He has been throughout
the life of mankind&mdash;from that very moment
when in the Garden of Eden He was spoken of
as the conqueror of the serpent. But He is also
the only one who</p>

<div class='center'>
"makes all earth feel joyful."<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />4. <i>To Join in the Song</i></div>

<p>"The angels join the singing."</p>

<p>Well, it is easy enough for them to sing when
we give the tone, for it is never too high for them.
It is different when we are to join when they lead
the singing. Sometimes it is a little bit hard for
us children of dust&mdash;but we must learn it.</p>

<p>They sang that Christmas Eve: "Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
men!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The first part of it is easy for you to sing, for
"the glory of Christmas is God's above the highest
sky." That's quite simple.</p>

<p>But when the angels then sing: "On earth peace,
good will toward men!" you stop short; you cannot
sing that. The tone is too high for you. When
you look at your own life, it seems to be burdened
much more with strife and worry and trouble than
lightened by peace. And what do the heavenly hosts
mean when they sing about good will toward yourself&mdash;O,
well, it isn't much!</p>

<p>Then if you look beyond the narrow confines of
your own life and behold the church of the Lord,
where peace should be far more firmly rooted, then&mdash;what
then? "The eye sees strife and only strife,"
and the people <i>speak</i> about peace and tremble in the
thunder of cannon. They <i>bleed</i> and <i>scream pitifully</i>
on the battlefield because of their wounds&mdash;and
at home under the pressure of military budgets.</p>

<p>No, you cannot join in the singing!</p>

<p>But how, then, could the angels sing as they did
that Christmas night? Was not the world filled
with war and disturbances in those days, too? Was
not the world full of souls in quest of lost peace?
Yes, even so! And the angels saw it. But <i>they saw
something more</i>.</p>

<p>Amidst all the restlessness of a disturbed world
they saw a little Child on His mother's knee. In
this child's eyes the sacred peace of Heaven was
reflected. So that was at least one human soul
in all the millions of mankind where perfect peace
reigned on earth.</p>

<p>Toward this, the only one, the angels looked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>When, then, you seek peace on earth, look not in
the direction of the world, of the struggling masses,
but look toward Jesus&mdash;not as He was that night
on His mother's knee in the inn near Bethlehem&mdash;for
He is there no more, but as He is in His church,
in His word, and in His institutions. His church
on earth is that mother's knee upon which you shall
find Him, and where you, in a world filled with
war and strife, shall find peace and repose for your
own soul.</p>

<p>The angels made no attempt whatever to penetrate
into the strife of the world or to unravel its
troubles. Neither shall you so do. On the other
hand, they tried to look into the eye of the Saviour,
and there they beheld Peace&mdash;a heavenly Peace
which they had not seen on earth since that evening
hour when Adam and Eve were driven out of the
Garden of Eden, and when one of their own kind
was placed on guard with a flaming sword at
the portals of Paradise. Then night fell upon
earth. But Christmas Eve the new day began to
arise from out of the darkness. Then they saw again
a human being in the depth of whose soul reigned
the Peace of Heaven, and therefore they bore their
good will.</p>

<p><i>The peace and the good will, then, was in this
one man</i>, and through Him born into the millions of
mankind. The angels had seen this one, and therefore
they could sing as they did.</p>

<p>Perhaps you say: Well, I can understand plainly
enough why God the Father and the holy angels
should bear Him good will. But were I to join
in the singing, I must needs be convinced that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Father would also bear me good will. That is what
I need to be convinced about. But here I stand telling
myself: The best acts in my life, the purest
thoughts in my soul, are darkened by sin. What
then?</p>

<p>Yes, that is true.</p>

<p>But, then, tell me: Have you not at times felt
the nearness of Jesus? Was not He your soul's
refuge in the darkness? Was not He like a luminous
star in your life? Was He not yours&mdash;conceived
within you in the sacred moment of baptism,
born into the world with pangs within your soul&mdash;perhaps
in the darkness of night? But then the
Father in Heaven does bear you good will. He
does not look at the darkness of sin within you&mdash;that,
He knows, will be vanquished by the light of
His son, but He looks at His only begotten Son
who is the luminous star of your life&mdash;the only one,
but splendid and bright.</p>

<p>Then you own in Him the Peace of Heaven and
the good will of God our Father&mdash;and then you
can <i>join in the singing</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />5. <i>The Joy of Understanding</i>

<br />(<span class="smcap">John</span> 1, 1-14)</div>

<p>Who among us does not remember Christmas
at home?&mdash;In my own childhood home there
was no Christmas tree, but a remarkably impressive
solemnity reigned above and upon all during Christmas.
Sometimes I still wish that I might become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
child once more and celebrate Christmas at home
again, with father and mother, grandmother and all
those dear ones. That cannot be done, however,
for all these beloved ones are having Christmas in
the mansions of Heaven&mdash;and I am no longer a
child. But about these Christmas memories, I want
to say: "God, let me never, never forget them!"</p>

<p>That was the joy without clearly conscious reasons.
One was glad just because it was Christmas,
but was unable to go into any further details about
the reasons.</p>

<p>But now I am a child no more!&mdash;Are we as
"grown-ups" to be satisfied with the memory of our
childhood Christmas, and by witnessing the pleasure
of the children&mdash;share a little of that Christmas
sentiment which envelops all?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, many people will answer: Yes, that
is all. Christmas really is meant only for the
children. Since we became experienced men and
women who have become acquainted with the vexations
and worries of life, we cannot thoroughly
enjoy Christmas. To us, the law of life has been
proclaimed in the words: "In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
ground; for out of it wast thou taken."</p>

<p>In the hard, wearying, suffering and struggling
life of the world, the unconscious joy, that is, the
joy that knows of no reason, is not enough. There
is a craving for a joy that knows and understands
the spirit of Christmas if one is to be completely
glad&mdash;that is true!</p>

<p>But what does the Gospel say:</p>

<p>"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the
only begotten of the Father), full of grace and
truth."</p>

<p>That means, that the only begotten Son of God,
who was with God and who was Himself God,
has descended and taken up his abode among us&mdash;-not
only among the children! No, indeed, also
among grown-up and experienced men and women
who must shoulder the burdens and heat of the day.</p>

<p>The Christmas message is the message that tells
us that <i>Jesus Christ, with Heavenly power and with
Heavenly love</i>, has taken up his abode among all
working, struggling and suffering people upon earth&mdash;not
like a haughty, indifferent onlooker at your
work, your exertions, your struggle as we might
imagine the son of the big manufacturer going into
the shop looking at the toiling, perspiring workers
with haughty, indifferent scorn and with a shrug of
the shoulder.</p>

<p>No, <i>Jesus Christ entered the life of mankind as a
benevolent and powerful participant in it</i>, so that
you, when you look at your work and wonder
whether you will be able to finish it&mdash;at your suffering
and wonder whether you can keep on suffering&mdash;never
shall reckon with your own strength
alone, but must include Jesus therein. He has
gone into your suffering, has taken up your fight and
your work for the purpose of suffering, fighting
and working with you and becoming your Saviour.</p>

<p>Therefore, He says: "Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest." That means: <i>All you men and women who
labor and are heavy laden</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>But when I can grasp a little of this, then I
enjoy Christmas&mdash;not because of the memory of
vanished days, but because of the understanding
of the fact that Christmas is meant just for
me who have experienced how much there is <i>to
labor for, to fight against, and to be saved from</i>,
and how sorely I stand in need of a heavenly support
of strength and love, in my daily work and
in my daily struggles.</p>

<p>Therefore, I now say: Christmas is meant for all
us grown-up men and women who take life seriously
and who know what are its conditions. We
cannot dispense with Christmas, at all. We offer
God our praise and our gratitude for Christmas,
and we do so <i>with the joy of understanding</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />6. <i>The Faith of a Little Child</i></div>

<p>On the west front lay a 17-year-old boy a few
days before Christmas, 1915. He had voluntarily
enlisted under the flag of Great Britain, and
was yearning to storm forward in the ranks of his
comrades&mdash;forward to victory. And he <i>had</i> been in
the front rank. Now he lay wounded and bleeding
on the battlefield.</p>

<p>The battle was over; the stars shone, and he
was thinking: Wonder, if I shall lie here and die!</p>

<p>Memories stormed upon him. His mother had
said: "God be always with you, my lad!" and the
old minister had said: "Remember there is always
a window open upward!"</p>

<p>Upward&mdash;upward to God! Was it not as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the twinkling stars were smiling at him&mdash;calling
him, as it were?</p>

<p>Yes, they summoned him upward.</p>

<p>O, how that wound pained him! Wonder if
the ambulance isn't coming soon? He could hear
the cries of the other wounded; perhaps that was
when they were lifted up from the ground. Would
no one find him? He could not stir, could not call&mdash;could
only gaze at the distant stars.</p>

<p>Was there room for him up there? Yes, for he
was sure death was approaching. "Mother," he
whispered, "mother&mdash;O God&mdash;take my soul&mdash;now,
just before Christmas&mdash;for the sake of Jesus
Christ!"</p>

<p>The angels came, and they carried him to heaven.
His prayer had been heard up there. His child's soul
was carried upward to God.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>When the famous French preacher, Adolphe
Monod, was asked what had been the cause of his
greatest gratitude, he said: "<i>I thank God that He
hath given me the faith of a little child.</i>"</p>

<p>The main thing for him was not that God had
given him a great task as a preacher and a theologian,
but that He had given him the faith of a
little child. That means: The faith that accepts
the grace of God <i>without making objections</i>!&mdash;</p>

<p>O, thou great and rich and powerful people: Lay
aside all thy bustle, all thy doubts, and all thy
suspicion toward God&mdash;lay it aside, all of it, and accept
the joyful tidings of Christmas with the faith of
a little child&mdash;without making objections. Then
thou wilt be glad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The well known French writer, Larradan, whose
pen formerly had written nothing but scorn against
faith, during the war implored his people to return
to the Christian faith as the only firm and
saving foothold. He writes:</p>

<p>"I laughed at faith and thought myself cocksure.
Now I no longer rejoice at my scornful
laughter, for I see France bleeding and weeping. I
stood at the wayside and saw the soldiers. They
went out to meet death&mdash;rejoicing. I asked: What
makes you so calm? And they began praying to
God saying: 'We believe in God!' I counted the
sacrifices of our people, and noticed that they bore
them praying. Then it became clear to me that
there was something comforting and sustaining in
recognizing an eternal home-country, when that of
the earth is glowing in the fire of hatred. This
feeling is science&mdash;the science of the child.... A
nation must despair if it does not believe that the
torment of the earth can be exchanged for the
joy of Heaven.... France was great in the days
of yore. But that was a France which had faith.
How about France in our own age? It is torn to
pieces with want and suffering. It is a France that
believes no longer. Will her future brighten? At
the hand of God&mdash;only at the hand of God.&mdash;France,
O, France, revert to the faith, to thy most
beauteous days! To go away from God is to perish!..."</p>

little child!</i></p>

<h2>THOUGHTS FOR THE NEW YEAR</h2>


<div class='center'><br />1. <i>To See Like the Angels</i></div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE striking feature of the way in which angels
see does not consist in their seeing everything,
both good and evil, in this world, in a rosy hue,
in heavenly glory so that they really do not see
the evil as it is&mdash;but in this that they see particularly
what is good and seek that by preference&mdash;let their
eye dwell upon, rest thereon, with pleasure. Therefore
we can sing:</div>

<div class='poem'>
To us He also smiles<br />
With Heaven's light in His eyes.<br />
</div>

<p>It is otherwise with that human being who is depraved
by nature. His eye seeks, with a certain
predilection, whatever is wrong in his fellow-beings,
dwells upon it with mischievous joy. It is an innate
fault which makes it difficult for us humans to embrace
one another, to smile at one another, in the
manner of angels.</p>

<p>Suppose that we in the new year make a serious
attempt to look at each other as the angels look&mdash;seeking
what is good in our fellow-beings. With an
earnest will we can accomplish much, especially
when we are sustained by prayer.</p>

<p>Let us begin at home!</p>

<p>Perhaps it is long since you, man, have embraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
your wife and given her a real <i>smile</i>. When she
was your bride&mdash;in the years of youth&mdash;that was
your greatest joy, but as the years went by you
found this fault and that with her, and then&mdash;why,
then you ceased embracing her and smiling
at her. It wasn't quite as bright in your home as
before. She became more and more reticent; her
rippling laughter&mdash;like that of a child&mdash;was heard
no more. Her cheerful songs were silent. She became
rather morose and querulous. A woman cannot
thrive where home is without smiles and love.
You accepted the slow changes as it behooves a
man of staid dignity&mdash;life teaches so much, also
compromise with ideals, and the realization that
the bright expectations of youth come to naught.</p>

<p>But, now suppose that it wasn't Life, but you
<i>yourself</i> that were to blame? Suppose the change
arose from the fact that you had been inconsiderate
to your wife. Your eye had detected her faults
and shortcomings rather than her good points? Try,
man, during the new year to look at her as the
angels look at us! Let your eye, diligently and
willingly, seek what is good in her, dwell upon it, be
jealous of it&mdash;give her all the appreciation she
deserves for making the home cosy and comfortable.
Try it with an earnest effort and a sincere prayer&mdash;then
you will once more feel like embracing her
and smiling at her as you did when she was the
bride of your youth. It might happen that you
would reap a <i>hundredfold</i> before the year ebbs out.
It will be brighter and more snug in your house&mdash;and
it will feel so good to be at home.</p>

<p>Or you, wife and mother, beginning to bend down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and "feel old" although you are just beyond thirty.
Perhaps you tell yourself: O, had I only thought
then that he was as he is&mdash;but I did not know.
And the children, yes&mdash;God knows, they are like
him&mdash;naughty and hard to manage. Instead of
staying at home to help a little with the children
in the evening&mdash;he just simply skips out.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Hush&mdash;wait a while!</p>

<p>In what way did you tell him this when you
asked him last to stay at home? Did you throw
your arms around his neck&mdash;did you <i>smile</i> at him,
saying: My dear, stay home with us tonight?</p>

<p>It's no use, you say&mdash;but "it's no use" is, absolutely,
a term which cannot be found in the vocabulary
of Christians nor in the life of Christians&mdash;nor
in yours if you are a Christian woman. It helps
very much to do what is good while praying&mdash;perhaps
not <i>when you</i> want it, perhaps not the way
you want it. But it will surely help if during the
new year you look for just that in your husband
which you loved when you were young&mdash;if you let
your eye dwell upon it, cling firmly to it in your
thoughts, carry it into your prayer&mdash;embrace him
and smile at him as in the bygone days of youth.</p>

<p>Where love has been sown, the harvest is as dependable
as is that of the wheat in the field&mdash;it is
only in some cases that it proves a failure. And
even though yours might seem to be just such a
case where your love did not sustain him&mdash;then the
love which you have sown will sustain you and
your little ones&mdash;and in the course of the year your
home will reap at least thirtyfold.</p>

<p>We always gain by sowing love&mdash;also in cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
where we must needs acknowledge that our love,
like the seed that fell by the wayside, bears no fruit
in those upon whom it descended. But in the
large majority of homes the seeds of love will fall
into fertile ground, and bring forth fruit, some
thirtyfold, some sixty and some a hundred.</p>

<p>When only we have learned how to embrace the
dear ones at home and to smile as the angels smile,
then we will also be able to smile at others&mdash;but first
at home.</p>

<p>And a year in which we have tried with earnest
diligence to learn the art of seeing what is good in
life, to dwell upon it and to smile at our fellow-beings&mdash;as
the angels smile&mdash;is a good year, rich in
the grace and blessings from above.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>I had just officiated at the funeral of a woman,
the mother of many children, when a man said to
me, "Well, now she's got a velvet-lined coffin, but
while she lived she was hardly able to get a calico
dress." And that was not because of poverty.</p>

<p>What if her husband had given her a velvet dress
while she was living! Then she would have taken
pleasure in it, and he would have received her
gratitude. The beautiful casket she could not enjoy&mdash;and
could give him no thanks for it.</p>

<p>But <i>you</i> don't behave like that, do you?</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>On another occasion I heard the widow ask one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the pall-bearers when we turned away from the
grave: "How did you like that sermon?" The following
day I met her son-in-law and was told that
she had not liked it at all. Among other things
he remarked: "She simply wanted you to put some
feathers in her crown, but there wasn't any room
for them." And I agreed with him.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>In both instances man and wife lived together until
parted by death. But love had died&mdash;happiness
vanished.</p>

<p>Speak to each other the kindly words&mdash;scatter
flowers on each other's way throughout the year,
then Love groweth, and happiness in the home increases
in intensity. Then you can truly sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Home, home, sweet, sweet home,<br />
There's no place like home&mdash;<br />
O, there's no place like home.<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>The Hidden Life</i>

<br />(<span class="smcap">Mat.</span> 6, 5-7)</div>

<p>The inscription on the tombstone erected on the
grave of the great French philosopher, Descartes
(died 1650), reads: "<i>He has lived well who was
hidden well</i>," or, "<i>He is happy whose life is hidden</i>."</p>

<p>In this lies the thought that happiness depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
upon the hidden life&mdash;that this is something good
which affords one a refuge.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the prevailing impression is that happiness
is contingent upon <i>life in public view</i>; that
happiness consists in the ability to attain a prominent
position, in being admired, gaining wealth and winning
fame. This is an absolute delusion.</p>

<p>Andrew Carnegie, the late multi-millionaire, said:
"I have tried to make money by leading an incessantly
busy life&mdash;but it did not make me happy.
Now I have tried to give money away to public
institutions&mdash;and still I found no happiness in that";
this is an impressive testimony from a prominent
and honest man, showing that happiness has nothing
to do with life in the public view.</p>

<p>It is this Jesus says to the Pharisees: You stake
all upon <i>leading your life in public view</i>, in the
synagogues and in the streets, to gain the admiration
of men. For this reason you have forgotten to seek
the good refuge with God, to lead a hidden life with
God, full of prayer. Therefore, your public life is
devoid of blessing to the people and without joy
to yourselves. <i>You have no reward, and no happiness.</i></p>

<p>"Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut
thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret."
You shall seek the hidden corners of your own heart
and there speak with your Father about that life
which stirs in there, unseen by the world. Then
you will soon realize the necessity of hiding with
God the Father and of living your life with Him
hidden away from the world. That is the condition
for your becoming a happy man or a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
woman, and it will contribute to the bliss of that
part of your life which must be lived before the
public.</p>

<p>Therefore, this shall be my New Year's wish for
you, that you <i>during the coming year may find the
happiness which lies in the hidden life of prayer,
with God</i>.</p>

<p>Many married people seem to think that their
matrimonial happiness depends on swell homes and
association with those more prosperous families
known as "society"&mdash;"Keeping up with the
Joneses." This is wrong. Attempts of that kind
often lead to the utter destruction of happiness. It
is true that a nice home and a pleasing circle of acquaintances
are worth much, but marital happiness
does not depend upon them. It springs from that
life which man and wife live together unseen by the
eyes of the world.</p>

<p>The happiest moments in the life of a wife are not
those in which her husband stands upon the stage
of the world, the object of praise and admiration&mdash;as
the man <i>to whom the laurel wreath is given</i>;
nor, in the life of the man, when his wife is considered
<i>a celebrated grand lady</i>. No, the sublimest
happiness in married life is due to those hours when
man and wife sit cheerfully at home, hand in hand,
talking about the grace of God and about their
mutual love.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>Many young people think that happiness and joy
depend upon the number of dances they are able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
attend, or upon exterior circumstances. It is not
their fault that they are neither happy nor glad. It
is due to the environment, living conditions, to those
with whom they associate. And while all this may
be of importance it is, profoundly seen, a delusion,
nevertheless. It is true, also, in the case of the
young man and the young woman that their happiness
essentially depends upon their hidden life. If
that is a life of impure thoughts, of sinful cravings&mdash;then
happiness will be meagre, no matter how
favorable the environment may be. There will be
no calm and deep-seated joy, no real happiness. If,
on the other hand, that hidden life means a life of
pure thoughts and noble ambition, a life in God,
then it will mean happiness even though the environment
may be unfavorable.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>It is a law in the life of mankind that happiness
depends upon the manner in which the hidden life is
lived. By creating this law, God has given rich and
poor an equal chance of happiness, and has shown
Himself as the friend of the poor.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>King Charles IX of France once asked the Italian
poet, Tasso: "Who, think you, is the happiest?"</p>

<p>Without a moment of hesitation, the poet answered:</p>

<p>"God."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, very well," the king said, "but then
next to God?"</p>

<p>"The one who resembles Him most," was the
answer.</p>

<h2>THE WORTH OF YOUR SOUL</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"FOR what is a man profited, if he shall gain the
whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Mat.
16, 26.)</div>

<p>The first thought is that of <i>the infinite worth
of the soul</i>.</p>

<p>In one scale of the balance Jesus places all the
world with its gold and gems, its art and science, its
limitless values of woods and prairie soil&mdash;and in
the other, a human soul. And then He says: Behold
all this splendor! Look at it all, thou yearning
child of man! It is not equal to the worth of
your soul.</p>

<p>Everything great and beautiful in life originates
in the human soul. Through that, all noble
thoughts and great ideas have come into being.
Every work of art was formed in a human soul before
it was painted upon the canvas, chiseled in marble,
or written in a book. It is the stamp of the
human soul that lends value to the work.</p>

<p>Revere that <i>mark of the soul</i> wherever you recognize
it! But have reverence, above all, for the
<i>soul</i> itself. That has the worth of infinity. To
"lose your soul" is to suffer everlasting damage
which cannot be repaired or substituted by values of
the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The other thought is that about <i>exchange for
your soul</i>.</p>

<p>Wherever that precious soul is demanded of you,
you can give nothing else in <i>exchange</i>. There is
nothing in the whole, wide world that has value
enough as exchange for a human soul. Neither is
there anything whose value can equal that of the
mark of your soul upon your work.</p>

<p>If you owe your neighbor ten bushels of wheat,
you may pay him back by giving him twenty bushels
of corn or cash in exchange, and he will realize that
he is paid in full. But this cannot be done where
rests upon you the giving of your soul.</p>

<p>This first of all you must consider in your relation
to God who gave you your soul. He will demand
it from you when your earthly life has
ended. If your soul then is seen to have suffered
corruption, it is not fit to enter into eternal life,
and you have nothing else to give God in its place.
It avails you nothing that you say: "O, Lord, I
know that I have been so occupied with worldly
things that I have not taken care of my soul, as I
should have done. But, in this way I have made
$10,000 which I now donate to missionary work."&mdash;My
dear, that cannot compensate for the wrong
that has been inflicted upon your soul.</p>

<p>David understood this. Therefore he said to
God: "For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would
I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering."
But God delights in a prayer like this: "Have
mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness;
according unto the multitude of thy tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me
thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from
my sin!" There is a human soul in this prayer&mdash;it
is true that it is a suffering soul&mdash;but it is
there.</p>

<p>Thus God demands that your soul be in your
<i>prayer</i>, your <i>praise</i>, and your <i>worship</i>, and there is
nothing else that can take its place.</p>

<p>The worship of the Pharisee was perfect, from
the point of form. Everything was done according
to rules and regulations. But it was <i>soulless</i>.
Therefore, Jesus condemns it. But where He hears
the prayer or sees the tears of repentant sinners,
He stands still. There he stoops, and in their wailing
and stammering worship He beholds a human
soul that has suffered wrongs&mdash;one, perhaps, which
is deeply tainted. But the soul is there, and it has
worth to Him. He can heal all the wounds of the
soul. And where the wounds of the soul are being
healed, worship takes place. But, then, the human
soul must take part.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>This is true, also, in worldly things. Where your
soul is demanded of you, you can give nothing else
in barter for it.</p>

<p>You may give your wife food and shelter, dresses
and footwear, but that is not enough. She has a
right to your soul. Golden rings and splendid
dresses cannot take its place. But if you do give
her your soul&mdash;in smiling joy or in a burst of weeping&mdash;she
will cling unto you with everlasting rejoicing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in her heart. In this devotion she will
recognize infinite worth.</p>

<p>Or your children! You may give them a good
education, may even leave them a substantial legacy.
But what God above all else demands of you, is that
you give them your soul&mdash;a father's soul and a
mother's soul, which they can learn to honor and
to love. To give them a substantial legacy as an
equivalent to this spiritual partnership is to give
them stones where bread is wanted.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>Remember, then, your soul's infinite worth&mdash;remember
that wherever it be demanded of you, in
your relations to God or men: You can give nothing
in its place.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this world which is valuable
enough to take the place of the human soul.</p>

<h2>THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN SHALL BE
REVEALED</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Mat. 10, 26</span>)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"FOR there is nothing covered, that shall not be
revealed; and hid, that shall not be known."</div>

<p>No one sees it, thinks the burglar when in the
hours of the night he breaks into a house. It is hidden
by darkness.</p>

<p>No one sees it, think the adulterer and the adulteress
when they satisfy their sinful lust. It is hidden
to others. It is their secret.</p>

<p>No one sees it, and no one will know about it,
the young man thinks when, covered by darkness, he
sneaks into the saloon.</p>

<p><i>Yes, God sees it!</i>&mdash;Yes, God! But, to be sure,
He doesn't tell the neighbors about it the next morning.
No, to be sure! But, nevertheless, it will be
brought forward in the light of the day&mdash;all these
secrets of darkness.</p>

<p>If that consciousness could but be vivid and
strong within us&mdash;how many criminals would then
keep away from the paths of evil!</p>

<p>And how many secrets of darkness would be revealed
to God through repentant confessions&mdash;and
be <i>forgiven</i> instead of <i>concealed</i> in the innermost
chambers of the heart like a guilty secret&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
guilty secret only to be covered by a new transgression.</p>

<p>"The Lord discovereth deep things out of the
darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of
death," says Job (12, 22).</p>

<p>When Judas had agreed to betray Jesus, he concealed
that evil secret in the innermost chamber of
his heart. But Jesus saw it in there. He saw that
this secret of darkness would push Judas into the
darkness without&mdash;down to despair&mdash;to perdition.</p>

<p>Therefore Jesus made an attempt to bring out
that secret from the darkness when they sat together
at the Easter meal. That is my understanding
of Jesus' pointing out Judas as the traitor. It is
as though he would say to him: O, listen, Judas,
let us bring that dark secret out into the light so
that it may be forgiven! But Judas arose and
went away. He wanted to keep the evil secret
to himself.</p>

<p>Happy he or she who asks Jesus to bring forth the
evil secrets from the heart so that they may be repented
and forgiven&mdash;so that their power may be
crushed! Then, on the great day they shall be
revealed as having been <i>repented of</i> and <i>forgiven</i>&mdash;to
the glory of the Lord who has released us from
the fetters of the evil secrets.</p>

<p>But it is not only the evil secrets that are to be
revealed in the light of the day. <i>All</i> secrets are to
be revealed.</p>

<p>Does man possess other secrets than those of the
darkness? Will there not be very little to bring
forth in the way of good secrets from the recesses
of the heart?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>No, thank God, there will be thousands of them.</p>

<p>All those loving thoughts which you conceived
in secret, and which you never found a chance to
express&mdash;they shall be revealed on that great day.</p>

<p>All the heavy sighs and all the burning prayers
which have issued forth from the depths of the heart
in secret, shall be made known in the light. And
they are countless. Generation after generation has
witnessed parents praying for their children&mdash;O,
could we but realize a small part of all that which
has been fought for and prayed for in secret! Then
we would be surprised to know that someone had
<i>thought so lovingly, had prayed so fervently, and
struggled so earnestly for our sake&mdash;in secret</i>.</p>

<p>All these good and pure secrets shall be revealed
on the great day.</p>

<p>How radiantly they will testify that the human
heart has not been merely the battlefield of the
secrets of darkness, as some seem to believe.</p>

<p>And together with all the evil secrets, repented of
and forgiven, they shall glorify our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ who endowed us with the gift of <i>wanting
to</i> think lovingly, pray fervently, and struggle
earnestly in secret.</p>

<h2>NOT IN WORD, NEITHER IN TONGUE</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"MY little children, let us not love in word, neither
in tongue, but in deed and in truth" (I. John
3, 18).</div>

<p>Five little girls stood in a garden telling each
other how dearly each one of them loved her mother.
The words became more and more emphatic until
finally Bertha&mdash;the eldest of them&mdash;poking her nose
upward, said decisively: "I love my mamma so
much that I could die for her sake." And thus
everyone was brought to silence.</p>

<p>But on a bench a little farther away in the garden
Bertha's aunt sat sewing; she overheard it all,
and then said: "It is strange that a little girl who
loves her mother so much that she would be willing
to die for her, does not love her enough to wash
dishes for her. I heard this noon, Bertha, that you
didn't want to do the dishes for your mamma!"</p>

<p>It is strange, indeed!</p>

<p>"My little children, let us not love in word,
neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth."</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>The young man says to his bride: "I love you,
darling, so much that I could carry you on my
hands all through life!"&mdash;A year after the wedding
it may happen that he cannot carry up a bucket of
coal from the basement for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>That's strange, too.</p>

<p>The young woman says to her fianc√©: "I love you
so much that I could die for you!"&mdash;But if it is a
question of that new Easter bonnet, she cannot save
a dollar out of regard for her husband's pocketbook:
She doesn't love him that much.</p>

<p>You do not love each other enough to <i>sacrifice</i>
for each other's sake&mdash;or to be a bit <i>patient</i> with
each other&mdash;or to <i>cut down a little</i> your own personal
demands out of regard for each other. Therefore
we have so many divorces.</p>

<p>"My little children, let us not love in word,
neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth."</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>Charles Dickens tells in one of his books of two
sisters who are discussing how intently they wish to
do something really great and good. Under the
petty circumstances at home they couldn't get the
chance. But if they might be sent out as missionaries
among the heathens&mdash;O, how they would toil
just to help those poor people! It didn't matter that
perhaps they would have to suffer the pangs of hunger
and persecution&mdash;if they only could show people
their love.</p>

<p>Just then their old grandmother who was sick
abed in the next room, said: "O, girls, won't one
of you come and scratch my back?"</p>

<p>"You can do that," the one said. "No, you'd
better do it," said the other. "It's always up to me&mdash;you
might do it once in a while!"</p>

<p>That was the end of the glory&mdash;and of the love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
On distant shores; under other circumstances they
would do deeds of love. But in that everyday life
where God had placed them, it wasn't quite as easy
as all that to show their love.</p>

<p>We can all catch ourselves in similar shortcomings.
We would like to be charitable on a grand
scale if we were <i>elsewhere</i> or <i>differently situated</i>;
but in everyday life&mdash;it is so prosaic just to help an
old mother, or a grandfather, or some sick and poor
person. And yet it is that which submits us to
the crucial test.</p>

<h2>SEEST THOU THIS WOMAN?</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Lu. 7, 44</span>)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>SIMEON is a benevolent Pharisee, deferential
toward Jesus, but icy and dignified.</div>

<p>The woman is a sinner, a former prostitute with
whom Simeon is disgusted; yes, he sees her, all right!
He knows her!</p>

<p>It is as when I ask someone: Do you know the
ocean? and he then answers: I should say so! I
have been standing in the downs watching the
waves; I have seen them soaring to the height of
houses while the wind whipped their foam into my
eyes. Yes, I have seen the ocean&mdash;I know it, all
right!</p>

<p>Then I answer: Pardon me, my dear&mdash;but if that
is all you have seen, you do not know the ocean.
You have not <i>seen</i> it while it lay calm and glittering
and smooth like a mirror in the sunshine, nor have
you <i>noticed</i> it when its surface was all alive with
ripples, and when it roared with that hollow sound
that betrays the presence of violent undertows far
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Thus with Simeon. That which he had seen and
heard of this woman, had been brought to him, like
the wind-swept foam of the sea, in the storm of
evil tongues, and then he says: I should think
I know her, indeed! I know to what kind she belongs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I see her&mdash;a low-down, vulgar and lewd
woman!</p>

<p>But the undertow in the depth of her soul he had
not seen; the heaving sighs from within he had not
heard. He did not know how often she had been
tossing restlessly upon her couch in moaning and
anguish, nor how firmly she had been clutched
by the wound-inflicting bonds of vice, nor how
strongly she had tugged at them in order that she
might set herself free.</p>

<p>And that was not the only thing Simeon did not
see. The wind-swept foam had veiled his eye so he
could not see what was really good in her at that
moment despite her appearance stamped with sin.
<i>There were bitter tears of repentance. There was
warmth of heart. There was love for Jesus.</i></p>

<p>Seest thou this woman? Seest thou this man?</p>

<p>How do you look at the people among whom you
live? Do you notice only the uncouth exterior?
Do you listen only to that which is carried to you
by the wind of the evil tongues? Or do you listen
to the undertow in the depths of the heart, to the
heaving sighs, the hollow roaring from within?</p>

<p>The famous Italian sculptor, Michelangelo,
once stood before a large coarsely chiseled slab of
stone which he surveyed carefully, and with increasing
pleasure, from all angles. "There is nothing
extraordinary about this stone," a friend remarked,
"what peculiarity do you notice?"</p>

<p>"What do I notice?" Michelangelo answered,
"I see an angel within this stone, and I must release
it."</p>

<p>It may be that our Lord Jesus did not exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
see an angel within this woman&mdash;nor does He see
one in you and in me&mdash;but beneath the rough surface
He saw a human soul created in the image of
His Heavenly Father and after His likeness, and
He said: I will release it!</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p><i>By looking at the undertow in the depths of the
soul and by listening to the heaving sighs from within,
you will be enabled to look at your fellow-beings
with ever-increasing interest and&mdash;delight!</i></p>

<h2>WHAT ABOUT THE DEVIL?</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHAT about the devil?&mdash;That is an exceedingly
difficult problem to the wiseacres of this
world.</div>

<p>Recently a learned professor proclaimed from his
speaker's chair that no single individual, no organization
of any kind, could rid the world of the devil,
but Time would&mdash;Time would most certainly get
him away. And the assemblage applauded enthusiastically
from out the joy of their hearts. Most
likely they did not stop to think at that moment that
Time would undo them long before it could ever
undo the devil. That may, however, be excused,
for learned people often are somewhat thoughtless&mdash;and
all these were scholars.</p>

<p>Or was the charity of the auditors so far-seeing
that it rejoiced in behalf of generations yet unborn?
Well, who knows&mdash;for that kind of people
also possess a heart.</p>

<p>Be that as it may.</p>

<p>But, concerning the devil&mdash;whether a devil
actually exists or merely is a creature of imagination;
whether he is a really dangerous foe or simply
a phantom from the days of yore&mdash;I must try to
make clear to myself, and you must do likewise.</p>

<p>It doesn't appear to be so difficult, after all,
when the matter is approached without any frills and
furbelows. I look at it this way: I have been baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to renounce the devil, all his works and all his
ways. That was told me at the moment of my
baptism. I affirmed it in order to be incorporated
into the Kingdom of God. Jesus Christ demands
of me that I renounce the devil if I am to be His
disciple. If, then, no devil existed, He who is Himself
the Truth and the Lord of the Kingdom of
Truth, at the outset must expect of me that I affirm
a lie&mdash;He whose own lips never knew untruth and
deceit, would ask that I in order to become a part
of His Kingdom, renounce a devil who does not
exist: That would not only be senseless: It is impossible!
When my Lord and Saviour tells me to
renounce the devil, then I do believe a devil exists,
and that my own welfare now and hereafter makes
it necessary that I keep away from him.</p>

<p><i>In this matter, the word of my Lord sufficeth for
me!</i></p>

<p>It is my faith in this which relieves me of many of
those speculative difficulties which entangle so many
others. I must choose between the word of my
Lord and the speculative mind of man. To me the
choice offers no difficulties at all. I choose the
word of my Lord&mdash;no matter whether or not the
scornful laughter sounds derisively from the other
side. And let me say it once more: The word of my
Lord sufficeth.</p>

<p>When, then, I meet some of those people who
claim there is no devil; that all talk about the devil
is a relic of ancient superstition, I simply say: You
must excuse me, but in this matter I abide by the
word of the Lord. I cannot ignore His word and
accept yours, and, furthermore, I have <i>no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
whatever</i> for doing so; I have never yet found that
I could not depend upon His word.</p>

<p>And if I then consider the ways of the world, as
they are&mdash;then I most certainly am not tempted to
abandon the covenant of my baptism. The works of
the devil are apparent to all: Murder, adultery,
theft, robbery, fraud, deceit, drunkenness, etc.
Many may say that these are the doings of evil
people, but if we look a little closer at these evil people
we will find that back of it all is one whose
thralls these poor creatures are.</p>

<p>If I try to look into the spiritual anguish of these
pitiful individuals, I am not tempted to give up my
belief in the devil. To be sure, I do not behold him
physically, but I see his works. To me it seems to
be as when I see a building is being erected. I ask:
Who is building this place? I am told: It is Mr.
Smith who builds this place, and we are his laborers.
I do not see Mr. Smith himself, but I notice that
his work goes on, and I do not doubt that he exists.
I see his laborers working, some sing and joke while
others are sullen and indifferent just because it happens
that they have entered into an agreement which
for the time being makes them realize their obligations
to Mr. Smith. If the latter could only find a
way to wriggle out of that relationship, they would
feel unspeakably relieved to do so.</p>

<p>Thus I see the works of the devil in the life of
man, and by seeing them I find no reason to doubt
his existence. The evil people are his laborers.
They work in order to complete his job&mdash;some singing
and joking, others under compulsion. It is clear
that especially the latter are the slaves of the devil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
By looking into the spiritual life of these miserable
ones I find confirmation of the word of my Lord that
there is a devil that must needs be renounced if we
are to live contentedly. It is from him our generation
needs relief, and not from all that ancient gossip
about him.</p>

<p>I said a little while ago that the word of the Lord
sufficeth for me in this matter, and that is true. It
does not correspond with the theories of the wiseacres,
but with Life itself. From the learned infidels
the cry is sounded: It isn't true. But from
the depths of real human life we hear the sigh:
<i>We are sorely troubled by the devil!</i></p>

<h2>TWO EPISODES OF THE CIVIL WAR</h2>

<div class='center'>1. <i>Looting Those Who Fell</i><br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE battle was over. Darkness expanded its
misty veil over the battle-field. Victory had been
won by neither army, but there were left a large
number of dead and wounded.</div>

<p>The ambulances were sent out with help for those
who fell in the fight. Where moans were heard,
they went, raised the wounded limb a trifle, asked
sympathetic questions and bandaged the wound as
well as could be done in a hurry; then the wounded
were taken to the field hospital.</p>

<p>But if one looked more carefully, other figures
were discernible; half hidden by the darkness they
sneaked about among the wounded and dead.</p>

<p>Who were they?</p>

<p>It didn't look as though they heeded the moans of
the dying, nor did they raise them to carry them
off to the field hospital. What were they doing,
then?</p>

<p><i>They were plundering those who fell</i>, taking from
them their little articles of value: A hideous thing,
truly a deed of darkness! Who would have believed
that anyone could have the heart to plunder
the dying.</p>

<p>You and I would not do such a thing. We become
intensely indignant and disgusted when told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
such heartlessness. "God, I thank thee, that I am
not as the other men are, extortioners&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>No, on that battlefield where the wounded lie,
having been hit by shells and maimed by swords, we
do not go in order to plunder and loot. That is
true enough.</p>

<p>But&mdash;alas, there is a "but" about it.</p>

<p>The world is a huge battlefield. Right and left
we see about us the <i>wounded</i> who are moaning and
suffering from pain; they are sighing for just a little
aid, a kind word, a gentle smile. They need succor&mdash;they
need being taken to the hospital. They
still have a remnant of the sense of honor left.
There is a possibility that they may right themselves;
that they may be able to qualify as good
fighters in the next skirmish&mdash;perhaps to conquer
where now they have suffered defeat. <i>But</i> instead
of the gentle smile, the kind word, and the little aid&mdash;we
took away from them whatever was left and
let them lie where they were. We deprived them
of the last remnant of honor, extinguished the last
faint glimmer of hope. The bruised reed was
broken. The smoking flax was quenched.</p>

<p>On Life's vast battlefield you and I may, after
all, have taken part in the plundering of the
wounded; or we may have gone by just like the
priest and the Levite. At least we have not always
done as did the Samaritan: Bound up their wounds,
pouring in oil and wine, and brought them to an
inn!</p>

<p>Old Dr. Bengel says: "I am kept constantly
busy by reading proof upon myself."</p>

<p>Let us do likewise. Then we will be better and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
better enabled to heed the moans of the wounded
on the vast battlefield of Life, and to bring them to
the inn, to the church of the Lord where there is
healing for all wounds. This is our task toward
the wounded, and it was that which was in the
mind of Jesus when He said:</p>

<p>"Go, and do thou likewise!"</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>Removed Because of Mischief</i></div>

<p>During the Civil War it became necessary to remove
one of the officers serving under General
Sherman; "Removed because of mischief" was the
way it was entered upon the record.</p>

<p>General O. O. Howard succeeded him in command
and continued to have charge of the unit
until the end of the war.</p>

<p>Then the army arrived at Washington, where a
parade was to be held followed by disbanding.</p>

<p>The day before the parade General Sherman said
to Howard:</p>

<p>"The political leaders demand of me that the officer
whose place you took, resume his charge tomorrow
and ride at the head of his unit in the
parade, and I wish you would help me out of this
predicament."</p>

<p>"But it is my unit now, General," Howard said,
"and it is but fair that I ride at its head tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," General Sherman answered,
"but&mdash;are you a Christian, Howard?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" Howard asked
astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean that you can bear that disappointment
and let him have the honor. You are a Christian,"
Sherman added; "well&mdash;what do you say?"</p>

<p>Like a brave officer, jealous of his honor, Howard
had anticipated this day with delight, but, after
hesitating a moment, he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, looked at from that point of view, only one
answer is possible: Let him ride at the head of his
old unit tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"All right then," said Sherman, "but you will
report at headquarters tomorrow morning at 9
o'clock."</p>

<p>The next morning at the appointed hour Howard
reported that everything was arranged. The officer
who had been removed because of mischief had
resumed his old post.</p>

<p>"Very well," Sherman answered, "then you ride
by my side today."</p>

<p>"I have no right to do that," Howard replied.</p>

<p>"It is an order," Sherman answered smilingly.</p>

<p>Thus O. O. Howard rode beside General Sherman
at the head of the entire army in the parade
at Washington&mdash;he who had renounced glory and
right for the benefit of one who had forfeited both,
so that the latter might <i>be honored</i>.</p>

<p>"Removed because of mischief." That might
have been written upon the brow of Adam when
the portals of Paradise were closed behind him.
Removed from the living God because of mischief&mdash;that
<i>was</i> the legend above the whole story of mankind
until the fullness of time.</p>

<p>Removed because of mischief&mdash;from one another,
from the respect of fellow-beings, from honor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
enviable positions among men: That was the legend
above the lives of so many&mdash;of him who had stolen
money from his master's till; of him who had suffered
a moral lapse, etc.</p>

<p>But into the life of him who has been removed
from God because of mischief one came and said:
It is my will that you resume your old place of
the child in the arms of his Father. It is my will
that you take part in the ride into the new Jerusalem.
I will share my rights with you and give
you my glory. Yes, thus speaks the Son of the
King of Heaven in His church upon earth.</p>

<p>This I have done for thee, Jesus says. But then,
when you go among those people who have been
removed because of mischief from good positions
or from the respect of their fellow-beings: How
much of your glory and rights can you give to them?</p>

<p><i>You are a Christian.</i></p>

<p>We ask, almost as surprised as O. O. Howard:
What do you mean by that, Lord? Too often, we
ourselves think too little of it. But Jesus sayeth:
Remember that you are a Christian when you associate
with those who have lost the respect of their
fellow-beings. As a Christian you must be able
to sacrifice a little of your honor and your rights
for their sake.</p>

<p>To be a Christian is not merely to be a child and
to rest upon the arm of the Father. <i>It is to make
real the love of the Father, in the steps of Jesus
Christ, among those who have fallen by the wayside.</i></p>

<p><i>You are a Christian.</i></p>

<p><i>Are you?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>And one thing more. Howard did not lose anything
by relinquishing his glory and rights like a
Christian. Far from it! He gained by it. He
was placed beside the supreme commander at the
head of the entire army. Thus with us.</p>

<p>When Jesus demands of us that we as <i>Christians</i>
shall bring sacrifices, then it is not for the purpose
of causing us any <i>loss</i>, or to make us <i>advance</i>
something for which we will not be reimbursed,
but simply to enable us to receive more from Him.
Such advances He changes into an income for us.
We will receive a hundredfold. We will be qualified
to be at the front, and by His side we approach
the goal.</p>

<h2>YOUR WORDS</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Mat.</span> 12, 37)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"FOR by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by
thy words thou shalt be condemned."</div>

<p>Isn't this a strange way of speaking?</p>

<p>If Jesus had said: "By thy works thou shalt
be justified, and by thy works thou shalt be condemned",
then I would have immediately conceded
that this was good common sense. Actions are
something tangible, something you can get the actual
"feel" of, but words&mdash;why, they often are nothing
but hot air.</p>

<p>Still Jesus says: "By thy words shalt thou be
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned"&mdash;so,
I must accept that.</p>

<p>When, then, I think of the words I have spoken,
at home, in the church, in the midst of the congregation,
I cannot conceal <i>to</i> myself the fact that
there were many empty words among them. Not
only that&mdash;there were also some mean words, and
when they are to be measured by Him who never
sinned, and whose lips never knew deceit, then I
must tell myself: There is enough right here to
condemn you! And I am possessed with <i>fear</i> and
worry because of my own words.</p>

<p>If I revert to the good words I may have spoken,
it isn't much better. And still, I cannot say but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that I doubtless have spoken some good words, and
that they may have been of benefit to some. I am
quite certain that I often have spoken good words
at sick-beds, in the homes and in the church&mdash;words
that were willingly listened to just because
they were good words, that really did comfort
those who were sick and had sorrowful souls&mdash;words
that were something more than sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal&mdash;words that were inspired
and filled with the warmth of my heart&mdash;words
in which I myself rejoiced sincerely, and for
which I could never sufficiently thank God that He
gave me the grace to utter them.</p>

<p>But, yet&mdash;in spite of all this&mdash;it does seem to me
that when my words are to be judged by Him
who always spake the pure, the powerful, the pungent,
and the perfect word&mdash;then mine will be found
wanting. In other words: I <i>doubt</i> that those words
of mine were so faultless that He who is Himself
faultless, would consider me justified by my words.
No, to the contrary&mdash;I must tell myself: Thou
art weighed in the balance and found wanting!</p>

<p>Thus I find myself placed between <i>fear</i> and
<i>doubt</i>&mdash;fear because of my evil words, and doubt
about the faultlessness of my good words.</p>

<p>What shall I do, then? Shall I timidly withdraw
from the words of the Lord: "By thy words
thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt
be condemned"?&mdash;Shall I attempt to forget them,
imagine that they were not meant for me, have no
bearing upon me&mdash;or shall I try to avoid them as
some fearfully avoid cemeteries at the midnight
hour?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>No, I cannot do that!</p>

<p>I must have these strange words clear in my mind.
I must work them through. To stand between fear
and doubt, timidly withdrawing from the words of
my Lord! No, that cannot be possible. Where
shall I seek refuge? Where shall I seek that explanation
which reconciles me with the word of
the Lord, and which brings peace into my soul?</p>

<p>I will seek refuge in the pledge of my baptism&mdash;as
so many others have done in the hour of worry
and distress. I let it pass upon my lips, and the
word is: "I <i>renounce</i> the devil and all his works
and all his ways." But to renounce means that I
break off from, separate myself from, and become
a foe of, the evil one and all that is evil&mdash;also my
own words. But can He, the fair judge, condemn
me for that which I disavow and separate myself
from, what I personally oppose?</p>

<p>No, it is impossible! That cannot be!</p>

<p>This gives me surcease. The fear of my evil
words must vanish, and, thus unburdened, I go on.</p>

<p>"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker
of heaven and earth.... I believe in Jesus Christ
His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the
Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and
buried; He descended into hell; the third day He
arose again from the dead; He ascended into
Heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God, the
Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.... I believe in the
Holy Ghost; the holy Christian church; the communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection
of the body, and the life everlasting."</p>

<p>The word of the Apostles' Creed is the word of
faith. And what did I say? I <i>believe</i>! It may be
feebly, alas, but nevertheless&mdash;with all its frailty the
heart embraces the word of faith, and doubt vanishes
before this word.</p>

<p>Almost astonished I ask myself: Is it possible?
Is it possible that I who found myself placed between
fear and doubt, conquer both by the word of
faith?</p>

<p>That word of faith has thus passed upon my lips,
not like a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal, but
as a <i>truth of the heart</i>. It was not a hollow saying,
it was not a faulty word, and yet it was my own.
It was given to me in the early morn of my life as a
gift from God in my baptism. Now it asserts itself
in spite of all the evil, empty and faulty words I
have spoken&mdash;reaches to the Lord Himself as an
expression of the innermost life of my heart, and the
answer of the Lord to this word is: By thy words
shalt thou be justified!</p>

<p>Thus, through the words of the Lord I gained
peace in my soul, and my heart bursts out its
"Praised be God!"</p>

<h2>BEHIND THE SHIELD</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Eph. 6, 16</span>)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>PAUL is imprisoned at Rome and is writing to
"the saints which are at Ephesus." He beholds
Christian life as one immense struggle&mdash;not
against flesh and blood, that is, against the depraved
elements in the life of mankind and the evil
tendencies in man; no, back of flesh and blood are
principalities and powers, a host of spirits trained
in the wiles and the cunning of the devil, and exercising
a tremendous power in the world, through
evil persons.</div>

<p>Against these gigantic powers we must needs
fight, and we must vanquish them. But we cannot
do so by our own power. We must be "girt about
with truth," must be clothed in "the whole
armour of God." This is not an armour that can
be forged from the steel within ourselves&mdash;although
we say that with all due deference to bravery,
shrewdness and wisdom; but in the great struggle
against the powers of darkness we must be girt with
something stronger. Fortified with <i>our own</i>, we
sustain wounds, but win no victory. The armour of
God gives victory, but protects against wounds if
we know how to use it rightly.</p>

<p>But when Paul describes the whole armour of
God, he strongly emphasizes a particular part of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
for he says: "Above all, taking the shield<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of
faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked." Thus it is a question of
making proper use of the shield rather than of the
sword. The church of the Lord has hitherto laid
stress on the use of the sword, and therefore the
result of the fight has often been a number of
wounded souls, for the sword wounds, while the
shield protects.</p>

<p>It is said of our heathen forefathers that they
knew how to <i>fight</i> as well as how to <i>rest</i> behind the
shield. They knew how to grasp all the hostile arrows
in their shield while they fought; when they
had fought themselves weary or spent all their arrows,
while the foe still had plenty of deadly arrows
to hurl against them, they knew the art of taking
a rest behind their shield in the midst of the shower
of arrows. Covered by the shield they gathered
strength for the purpose of resuming the fight with
axes and spears while the enemy uselessly wasted
his supply of arrows.</p>

<p>I wish sincerely that we possessed somewhat more
of this ability of our forefathers to use the shield,
to <i>fight and to rest behind the shield of faith,
spiritually speaking</i>. That would make it possible
for us to give battle the thunder of which would
resound in the remotest corners of the earth, as in
days of yore the song and the hammer strokes of
our forefathers were heard in distant countries.
Then we would not use our fighting ability to plunder
foreign shores, but to lead the fight against the
spiritual powers of evil&mdash;to be in the front ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
during the fight that shall be fought from the sea
to the ends of the earth, in which thousands must
bleed because they have not learned how to use
the shield of faith.</p>

<p><i>We shall make a stand against the wiles of the
devil!</i></p>

<p>If I am not very much mistaken by the signs of
the age, the attacks on the church of the Lord will
during the present century become still more
marked by diabolical cunning and cleverness than
ever before. <i>The arrows</i> will be sharpened with
all the shrewdness of science, directed against us
with cunning, glowing with a devilish hatred against
everything that is of heavenly birth, and aims at
heavenly goals. Indecent jokes, cutting scorn and
cleverly formulated inquiries will constitute a cloud
of arrows which will darken the sun to many. They
will be hurled against us through the means of literature
and science, with violent haughtiness, with
fierce hatred. And we&mdash;we have not that unconquerable
courage which enables us to say with the
hero of Thermopylae: "So much the better&mdash;then
we fight in the shade!"</p>

<p>How shall we approach the struggle of the twentieth
century?</p>

<p>Someone may say: We shall sharpen our arrows,
make them pointed, and send them forth with
shrewdness and wisdom. We shall use our common
sense, meet the opponents on the battlefield of
thought and cleverness, show them what is unenduring
in the chimera of the atheists and what is
depraved in the life without God. In the church
of the Lord we have men who are not inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
our opponents in respect to cleverness and wisdom&mdash;indeed,
we have, praised be God!</p>

<p>But it does seem to me that many a valiant
fighter will succumb in this kind of a struggle, and
many plain-thinking Christians may flee, as did the
Philistines in ancient days when their giant had
fallen. All honor to those who defend and promote
the Kingdom of God by thought, by reasoning and
by wisdom! But along that way we do not accomplish
much more than to humbly admit that</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Stood we alone in our own might,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our striving would be losing."</span><br />
</div>

<p>More and more the shibboleth must be: "Above
all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall
be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
Learn how to fight, covered by the shield! That
means: All your struggle must be based upon the
words of faith, all your arguments must take these
as their point of departure instead of using human
sagacity and the tricks of interpretation; then
you will be unconquerable. And if it does happen
that you become weary in the fight against the wiles
of the devil, or that your arrows are all spent while
the foe has plenty, then do as our fathers did:
Take a rest behind the shield! Cover yourself completely
with the words of faith, then no hostile
dart will reach you, far less wound you. On the
contrary&mdash;you rest and gather strength while the
foe exhausts himself uselessly, and "all the fiery
darts of the wicked are quenched."</p>

<p>This method of fighting is especially adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the people, and it is <i>the age of the people</i>, also in
the church of our Lord. The future does not require
a great chieftain with a host of good-for-nothings
behind him, but an army whose every individual
is trained in the use of the shield of faith.</p>

<p>When Mr. Moeller-Anderson, a Dane with a
warm and faithful heart, a Dane whose quiet ways
his compatriots abroad do not forget&mdash;in the summer
of 1888 made regular sailing trips from Copenhagen
to Sweden for the sake of his health, it happened
one day aboard the vessel that some scoffers
wished to have fun with him. They may have
thought that it would be an easy matter to subdue
him. They, therefore, started a conversation with
him, but soon their speech changed to scoffing and
witty questions, daring attacks upon Christianity.
Then Mr. Moeller-Anderson replied: "I don't
know how that all may be, and I cannot answer
you, but if you wish to know what my faith is, then
I will confess my faith through the Apostles' Creed
before you right here!"</p>

<p><i>The scoffers had nothing more to say!</i></p>

<p>What had Mr. Moeller-Anderson done which
made them silent? Had he told them a striking
joke which could not be commented upon, or had
he stated a cleverly formulated truth which they
could not resist? No, he rested behind the shield
and the scoffers realized that <i>he was protected</i>.</p>

<p>You Christian man and woman from the everyday
walks of life&mdash;when you meet the scoffers, then
don't try to find clever thoughts with which to defend
Christianity, as though that were your way
to victory. In that case it would merely become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
question as to which side was supported by the
greatest wisdom, the most cleverly pointed shrewdness.
The great struggle of the world is the <i>struggle
of faith</i>, and it must by no means be changed into
a chaos of personal trickery and clever stratagems.
Above all, grasp the shield of faith instead of resorting
to your own wisdom and cleverness. Say
your creed plainly and simply, you mother of a
child, you master of the home, you young man and
woman among your chums, when you meet the devil
and his wiles in the form of clever questions formulated
so as to entangle you in self-contradictions&mdash;catch
you in the net of words as formerly the Pharisees
and the Herodians tried to catch Jesus asking:
Is it lawful to give tribute unto C√¶sar?</p>

<p>You often hear it said: You claim that God loveth
mankind: But why, then, does <i>He</i> let some suffer in
all eternity? Or, you claim that you have a good
Father in Heaven who can do everything: How is
it, then, that He lets His children suffer distress on
earth? etc.&mdash;Say it plainly and simply: Well, I
can't answer questions like these, for I do not see
through all these things, but if you want to know
what my faith is regarding salvation, then I will
confess my creed right here before you! That's to
rest behind the shield, and you will feel how blissful
that is compared with the fight by wisdom and reasoning
in which there is the fear of being wounded
and vanquished, and of rendering harm unto Christianity
by attempting an unsuccessful defence.</p>

<p><i>Behind the shield of faith: there is victory both
when you fight and when you rest!</i></p>

<p>Paul was not afraid of fighting. Neither must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
we be. But that fight which gives victory without
wounds, without one painful sensation to limit the
joy of victory, must be directed from a <i>covered
position</i>. And the agility necessary to enable one
to seek cover behind the shield of faith is obtained
only by <i>daily training</i>. Therefore, train yourself
every morning to protect yourself by the words of
faith before going to your work and fight your fight;
and in the evening when you lie down to rest,
you must train yourself so that in fight as well as
during the lull, you can be covered by the shield of
faith; then you will conquer the wiles of the devil,
and his fiery darts will not wound you.</p>

<p>Thus I consider it essential for the church of
the Lord in the twentieth century that it learns how
to use the shield rightly whether in fight or at rest.
The <i>struggle</i> of the church will then result in a
greater victory and in fewer wounds than during
the last century, and its <i>rest</i> will become increasingly
beneficent and strengthening while its restlessness
will become less nervous and less strength-consuming.</p>

<p>Wonder if the time has not come when the
church, driven by inner friction and by enemies
from without, will listen readily to the apostolic
warning: "Above all, take the shield of faith,
wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked."</p>

<p>I look forward to the day when the Apostles'
Creed becomes the <i>universal slogan</i> for all Christian
organizations. Then the church of the Lord
will march forward to victory.</p>

<h2>LOVE ME&mdash;AND TELL ME SO</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AN English bishop was traveling in India to inspect
the mission work, and when his journey
was completed, a farewell gathering was held in his
honor. On this occasion the bishop spoke on the
words: "Love me&mdash;and tell me so!"</div>

<p>He had often asked himself whether his congregation
at home really loved him. He thought it
did; but sometimes he couldn't help wishing: If they
only would say so! Now he wished to say, by way
of a parting greeting, to the Christians: Love your
ministers, and let them know that you do! They
need your love, and they need to be told that you
actually do love them.</p>

<p>This little speech reached England before the
bishop arrived there. When, upon reaching home,
his congregation received him with a banquet. On
the wall of the hall, just opposite the main entrance
door, was an inscription in large letters ornamented
by leaves and flowers: "We love you, and we are
saying so." That was the first thing the bishop saw,
and he rejoiced.</p>

<p>Love me, and tell me so! That's the cry from
thousands of souls yearning for love, and where
the cry finds an answer the heart rejoices. Where
no answer comes, life will be utterly miserable.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a wealthy woman met a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
orphan who looked imploringly at her. "What do
you want me to give you?" she asked. "O, just
like me a little bit!" the orphan answered.</p>

<p>O, just love me just a little bit!</p>

<p>I have seen that prayer where one should least
expect it&mdash;I have read it in the eyes of a mother
when they rested upon her grown-up daughter. She
had indeed grown, was taller even than her mother.
And then she had received an <i>education</i>&mdash;mother
surely could be proud of such a big and fine girl who
had learned so much! But a mother's heart finds
no sustenance in mere pride. It required delight in
the daughter&mdash;and there is delight only in love. But
the girl went about so <i>fine</i> and <i>big</i> and <i>cold</i> while
the mother, even as the poor orphan, implored, O,
love me just a little bit!</p>

<p>All you nice and big children: Remember that
mother and father need your love! Love them&mdash;and
tell them that you do! You can tell them in a
number of ways, and it will be rewarded, for in
love there is a world of joy.</p>

<p>Love me&mdash;and tell me so! O, love me just a
little bit!</p>

<p>I have read that prayer in the eyes of a wife:
Her husband was a man in whom she surely could
take delight. He was efficient; everybody admired
him, women especially, and he seemed to like everybody.
Indeed, she could be proud of such a husband!
There were plenty of women who envied
her and wished themselves in her place. And&mdash;how
beautifully he could speak of domestic love&mdash;women
were deeply touched, and their eyes moistened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
when he did so. O, if they only had such a
husband&mdash;but such a one had not fallen to their
lot!</p>

<p>He had plenty of smiles and kind words and
love for everybody else&mdash;only not for his wife who
sat at home. Hard-hearted, frigid and haughty he
passed her by when she sat with the baby on her
knee, with despair penetrating all her features, and
the one prayer was flaming in her eye: O, love me
just a little bit&mdash;just a little bit, O, please do!</p>

<p>Love me&mdash;and tell me so! O, love me just a
little bit! That has been written in the eye of ever
so many poor and forlorn human beings&mdash;especially
among those who seemed to have become sadly
superfluous in the busy life of the world. Now
and then I have heard just such people say, with a
strange mingling of wistfulness and joy vibrating
in their voice: To think that the minister would
call upon me! Nobody else ever comes here. Nobody
cares about me any more!</p>

<p>Thus many a man or woman has been placed in
that miserable kind of solitude in the midst of
throbbing life. Nobody cares about me. Love me&mdash;and
tell me so! O, love me just a little bit,
please! That's the cry from the depth of their
hearts, but it is uttered as though in some limitless
desert: No answering sound is heard&mdash;there is no
sign that anyone cares for them. This is heartrending.</p>

<p>Yes, that is true. But if these lines of mine might
reach some such poor soul, then I would say: It
isn't quite as bad as this. Let your yearning for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
love soar upward to that God who listens to the
sighs of the heart of dust, and then you will hear
the response: I love you&mdash;and I tell you that I
do. I have told you so through my only begotten
Son: "For God so loved the world, that He gave
His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>

<p><i>This has been said to mankind plainly enough.</i>
And these plain words are not merely written in the
leaves of the Book of Books. They are inscribed
in the very life of mankind with the blood of the
only begotten Son.</p>

<p>Such words are not merely for the happy world
surrounding you. It means <i>you</i>&mdash;just exactly you
who are yearning for love: For your sake these
words have been spoken.</p>

<p>But we who are more fortunately situated&mdash;we
who enjoy the love of God and of our fellow-beings,
and who, in return, love those in our homes, in
our circle of acquaintances and in the church&mdash;let
us tell one another about it in a good and nice way.
So much joy of love is lost&mdash;just because it finds
no expression. For this reason so many gradually
come to doubt that they really are being loved.</p>

<p>The congregation wrote it on the wall of the
festival hall, ornamented with leaves and flowers.
It went out of its way to say it in just such a
way as to make its old bishop feel deeply delighted.</p>

<p>It pays to exert yourself in this way.</p>

<p>Let it be written with large letters between minister
and congregation, between man and wife, between
parents and children&mdash;yes, let it be written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with large letters&mdash;and wind about them the leaves
of the forest, the flowers of the field&mdash;everywhere:
We love you, and we tell you so! Then our lives
will become rich with the joy of love.</p>

<h2>TO BEAR BURDENS</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Gal.</span> 6, 2)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"BEAR ye one another's burdens,  and so fulfill
the law of Christ," Paul says.</div>

<p>"No, thank you!" you say, "I have quite enough
in taking care of my own burdens. If I am to be
troubled with those of others in addition, life will be
intolerable."</p>

<p>Nevertheless&mdash;do you think Paul speaks aimlessly?
Or isn't it rather the case that there is something
of <i>relief</i> in bearing burdens for others&mdash;something
of a <i>gain</i>?</p>

<p>Think of a wheat field: One straw stands close
beside the other. The wind-storm sweeps the field.
The wheat bends down in billowy undulations under
the heavy pressure of the wind, but rights itself
stronger than ever before. The close-standing
straws bore the pressure together. Then the wheat
is harvested. A few straws are left standing. The
wind again sweeps across the field, the lonely straws
bend down to the soil&mdash;and lie there. They are
broken. Singly, they could not resist the pressure
of the storm.</p>

<p>Thus in the life of mankind. Great burdens can
be shouldered with ease when shouldered in common
while the smaller burdens may crush and destroy
those who stand all alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>There is relief in bearing burdens for others.</p>

<p>But you ask: Dare I, a single individual, try
to shoulder the burdens in my home, in the church?
Suppose that in one or more instances I were the
only one to do so. The others left it all to me, although
they had the same obligations that I have&mdash;what
then? Will I accomplish anything but being
crushed under the weight of the burdens?</p>

<p>How about Jesus Christ when He, <i>all alone</i>,
bore the sin of mankind? He was wounded for
our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities,
as the prophet had foreseen.</p>

<p>But when He who was so strong, was wounded
and crushed under the weight of the burdens&mdash;what
will happen to me, then, when I shoulder the burdens
of others? I cannot do so cheerfully and courageously
and expect a satisfactory result. Rather I
must flee timidly away from the burdens by recalling
what happened to our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Yes, if that was all that may be said about
Jesus that He was "wounded and bruised" when
He, out of the depths of His love, shouldered our
burdens, then no doubt you are right. Then there
is no prospect that you will do better.</p>

<p>But that isn't all.</p>

<p>After having been wounded and bruised under
the weight of the burdens, bent to the ground, indeed,
bent in death, He arose with the mark of
victory upon His brow, and with <i>peace</i> and <i>healing</i>
for us.</p>

<p>Yea, <i>peace and healing</i>!</p>

<p>That was the last, the ultimate result. And it
is the law in His church that wherever we shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
one another's burdens, we shall find peace and
healing.</p>

<p>We may be wounded, indeed crushed, under the
heavy pressure of those burdens. We may be bent
down into the dust, but that is not the last, the
ultimate result.</p>

<p>It is peace and healing.</p>

<p>Thus it is not only a <i>relief</i> to bear one another's
burdens; it is the highway to peace and healing.
We can extract this blessed fruit from out of the
burdens. How splendid to be able to bear the
burdens of everyday life with and for one another
and to gain peace and healing for those who are
timid and bruised. <i>This is the last and final result
of bearing one another's burden in the name of
Jesus.</i></p>

<h2>BE STEADFAST IN PRAYER!</h2>


<div class='center'><br />1. <i>A Gain and a Protection</i></div>

<div class='drop-cap'>O &nbsp; PRAY for me!</div>

<p>That is one of the cries that frequently
come to us from the sick and the dying&mdash;sometimes
because they have not themselves learned how to
pray in the days that passed, but always with the
consciousness that prayer is <i>needed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pray!</i> sayeth our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is
<i>helpful</i> to pray. And on the background of nearly
two thousand years of actual experience His church
responds: Indeed, it is helpful to pray!</p>

<p>"Ask, and it shall be given you ... for everyone
that asketh receiveth.... Or what man is
there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he
give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give
him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your children, how much
more shall your Father which is in heaven give
good things to them that ask him?" (Mat. 7, 7,
etc.)</p>

<p>The prayer is a <i>gain</i> to us since we have such a
generous Father who will not refuse us anything
good, and who has it in His power to give us
all.</p>

<p>But the prayer also is a <i>protection</i>. "Watch and
pray, that ye enter not into temptation" (Mat. 26,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
41). The ability to be absorbed in prayer is a
protection against temptations, and in the prayer
strength and fortitude are secured with which to
resist the temptations.</p>

<p>In complete realization of this the Apostles continuously
implore us to pray.</p>

<p>Make the prayer a regular and constant feature of
your daily life. Don't let it be a matter of chance
whether you offer a prayer or not. Don't let every
insignificant hindrance prevent you from saying your
prayer. Many of the ancient leaders in the church
of the Lord set aside several hours a day, parts of
their most propitious working time, for praying&mdash;and
considered that a gain. Thus Luther often devoted
three or four hours a day to constant prayer.
You may not accomplish anything like that, but you
are able, nevertheless, to give the prayer a fixed and
constant place on your schedule for every day, and
then you will experience that it is a gain and a protection;
for "prayer brings down from Heaven the
peace of God; it brings down the strength to love
and revere Him; it brings down from Above relief
in the hour of distress, and it brings infinite comfort
at the moment of death."</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>What Mother Taught Me</i></div>

<p>A chaplain at one of our insane asylums related
the following:</p>

<p>One day when he had been preaching a sermon
to these poor, insane people among whom only a few
were able to make out what he said, one of them
came to him and announced: "I, too, can pray!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The chaplain stopped surprised, because the man
was completely an idiot. He had forgotten everything&mdash;his
name, his age, his home; about these
things he could give no information whatever.
Somewhat doubtfully, the chaplain asked him:
"What can you pray?"</p>

<p>The poor fellow righted himself a little and answered:
"What mother taught me"; he then folded
his hands and spoke the following verse with perfect
ease, and without mistakes:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Lord Jesus, who dost love me,<br />
O, spread thy wings above me,<br />
And shield me from alarm.<br />
</div>

<p>Everything was forgotten. Not one event in his
life was he able to recall in his memory. Everything
had been left out of his soul, out of his
memory&mdash;only not that one prayer his mother had
taught him.</p>

<p>I have myself had a somewhat similar experience.
It was a Dane who was not wholly demented&mdash;rather
what is known in the vernacular as "crazy"&mdash;and
a little more. He never did any harm, and
for that reason he was sent to the poor-house
instead of to an insane asylum. Whenever he found
an opportunity, he made his escape, and once in a
while he came to my home&mdash;once at eventide and he
was then allowed to stay overnight. In the evening
he sat plucking at his clothes just like a child, and
he then said: "I'm clean enough, all right." A
little later he said: "I ain't forgotten how to pray&mdash;want
to hear me?" Then he folded his hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
spoke two little verses of the kind a mother teaches
her very young child. These he could remember.
It was the same thing over again: What mother
taught me.</p>

<p>Remember this, you Christian mothers!</p>


<div class='center'><br />3. <i>The Evening Prayer: A Protection</i></div>

<p>Above all, it is important to give the evening
prayer a fixed and permanent place in the daily
schedule of our life. When we intend to pray for
something, the time at which it is done may be
relatively immaterial, but if we think of the prayer
as a <i>protection</i>, the evening prayer goes before anything
else.</p>

<p>And why?</p>

<p>Because it requires the peaceful quiet of eventide&mdash;and
the same thing is true about all kinds of silly
fun and of evil. In point of time, the evening
prayer meets with the tempting voices of wickedness
that sound with the greatest irresistance in the
darkness. A decisive battle thus takes place between
the tempting voices of wickedness and the
evening prayer&mdash;a battle about time; it is a Whether&mdash;Or,
for to divide the time in twain in this matter
is impossible. It is not possible to devote one evening
hour to wickedness, and the other to prayer.
Then, if the evening prayer is given a regular place
in one's everyday life, it is a protection against the
temptations.</p>

<p>Therefore the evening prayer should be a part of
the child's life even 'way back in the days of the
cradle. And therefore we praise the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the evening prayer is just that prayer which it is
easiest for a mother to make a part of the everyday
life of the child; this is not a mere accident, but
is due to that grace of God which descends upon
Christian mothers. Say the evening prayer with
your child, and for your child, every evening when
you tuck him or her into bed&mdash;do it even before the
babbling voice of the child is able to say the words
after you&mdash;and do never miss an evening!</p>

<p>The evening prayer which has thus been implanted
in the heart of the child because of the
privilege and the intense love granted to the mother-heart,
and which is to be protected by that same
love throughout the years to come, will prove to be
a real protection to the child during its earliest
youth, which is just the very time when it stands
most in need of <i>protection</i> because the tempting
voices of wickedness resound with the greatest
power in its own breast. For that reason the time
of youth is that period of our life when we stand
most in need of the evening prayer.</p>

<p>Loving parents often are somewhat worried when
they discuss the day that the children must go <i>out
into the world</i>. Now and then a tear drops from
the mother's eye when she thinks that her half-grown
boy or girl soon must leave home. It is not
because of worry for their future, economically
speaking, nor always because of the thought of
separation&mdash;but it is the fear; How will they come
out? Will they listen to the voices of wickedness,
find evil associates, forget both God and their parents
so that they rather seek the <i>saloon and the
dance hall</i> than the home of their childhood? Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
course, you may say: It won't be as bad as that!
And, praised be God&mdash;these things do not happen
in a great many instances. But the danger is there,
and the temptations are ever present&mdash;and many a
young man and woman who during childhood were
the very joy and pride of their parents, succumb
to the temptations and suffer during their youth
such defeat that recovery is possible only much later
in life or&mdash;never:</p>

<div class='center'>
You suffer for that through many years which only was briefest delight&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>But to comfort such parents let me say: Let
the evening prayer find a fixed and permanent place
in the life of the child from the very days of the
cradle&mdash;then you have built a fortification about it
which will guard and protect it at all times because
it has become an essential part of itself. The evening
prayer of its mother is the last thing the child
ever forgets&mdash;that which it is most difficult to part
with. It does not yield to a little push or two, but
will powerfully assert its right to occupy the seat of
honor in the heart, and it will insist that the quiet
hours of eventide belong to it by right. And even
though the child throw its mother's evening prayer
overboard in order better to heed the tempting
voices of wickedness, he or she will be conscious of
restlessness and uneasiness in the depths of the heart,
until that demand is met which the evening prayer
makes. Yes, even though the child may time and
again scoff haughtily at the evening prayer and thus
apparently get far enough to push it away with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the silly "nerve" of the age of adolescence and to
conquer it&mdash;that time will come, is sure to come,
when the memory of it and the memory of mother
awakens in the child's heart and revives in loving
remembrance so that the evening prayer resumes its
permanent place in the life of the child. The memory
of mother will be a treasure to the child who
only then realizes that the evening prayer proved
a protection against the plentifulness of temptations.
She will receive the gratitude shown her with
child-like reverence, because she implanted the evening
prayer in the heart of the child. That was one
of the mother's deeds of love that became the greatest
blessing throughout the storm-tossed time of
youth. When everything else sinks into forgetfulness,
it will still be remembered "what mother
taught me"!</p>


<div class='center'><br />4. <i>The Morning Prayer: A Gain</i></div>

<p>It is a little more difficult to give the morning
prayer a fixed place in our life than the evening
prayer, because in the morning we feel strengthened
by sleep and are in a hurry to get to our work. But
if we thus seem to think that we cannot find time to
say a morning prayer, let us remember the old
proverb: "In prayer is no delay," and if there are
other reasons&mdash;petty things that have hindered us&mdash;then
let us summon our will and say to ourselves:
<i>I want to!</i> The morning prayer is henceforth to
have a fixed place in my everyday life and in my
home, and I think everything will go well: In
prayer is no delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as the evening prayer because of the significance
of time is particularly adapted as a <i>protection</i>
against temptation, so the morning prayer for a corresponding
reason is especially fit to prove a <i>gain</i>
to us.</p>

<p>When we arise in the morning, the day is facing
us, and it is of importance that we approach our
work with willingness and high hopes&mdash;whether the
work be that of the intellectual or the manual laborer.
But, how often is it not the case that we
approach our work slovenly and sourly&mdash;with the
consequence that we feel it a burden and a difficulty.
We do not discover that rest and that joy
in the work which God bestowed upon it. The
work becomes nothing but unwillingly done toil,
and the day seems long and weary.</p>

<p>By way of suggesting a preventive I know of
nothing better than to start the day with a morning
prayer. It stimulates the willingness to work, to
begin the day by thanking God for the night that
has vanished, and to pray for blessing upon the work
of the coming day. It imparts joy of living. It
makes it easier to discover the rest and the delight
in work, no matter how exerting that may be.</p>

<p>How often is it not the case that the man who is
ready to go to his work, gets up silently and grouchingly,
washes himself and sits down at the table:
Breakfast is not yet ready, and his wife gets for this
reason some nagging reproaches. At last the meal
is served. Silently the man partakes of his breakfast,
takes his hat and his dinnerpail, remarks sulkily
that now he is going&mdash;and goes. Such a start promises
a cheerless day for both man and wife. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
goes to his shop or field with head bent low and
his mind heavy while his wife takes up her duties
at home&mdash;without cheer.</p>

<p>How different would not the <i>day</i> and the <i>work</i>
be for the man and wife if they could unite in a
little morning prayer and part with the words of
the poet upon their lips:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Then gladly we go<br />
Each to his work<br />
Relying upon God's grace.<br />
Thus gaining strength<br />
To be of use, as God wills<br />
In the very best way we know.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And that applies to all of us.</div>

<p>We all need to be told that we should go to our
work with more gladness, rely more upon the grace
of God, get more and more strength and joy wherewith
to do our work so as to please God. To this
end, the morning prayer is an incentive, and that is
why I consider it a <i>gain</i>.</p>

<p>Just as the time of youth is the period when we
stand most in need of the evening prayer because the
temptations then are the strongest and meet with
least resistance on our part, so we need the morning
prayer the most at the time of maturity because it
then is of particular importance that we</p>

<div class='poem'>
&mdash;&mdash;gain strength<br />
To be of use, as God wills,<br />
In the very best way we know.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>This does not mean that there is any time in our
lives that we do not need the evening prayer as well
as the morning prayer. Indeed, we need both
throughout our entire life, for we are always in
want of protection against temptations, always in
need of gaining increasing joy of living and happiness.
Therefore, let us give both a fixed and permanent
place in our everyday life and thus try to
become "steadfast in prayer."</p>

<p>And in that steadfast prayer <i>the Apostles' Creed</i>
and <i>the Lord's Prayer</i> must be absorbed as an inseparable
part.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2>ZACCH√ÜUS</h2>


<div class='center'><br />1. <i>To Be Home By Oneself</i></div>

<div class='drop-cap'>"AND, behold, there was a man named Zacch√¶us,
which was the chief among the publicans, and
he was rich."</div>

<p>Consequently he must have been a happy man,
many would think, for the conditions of happiness
are riches and prominent positions. But Zacch√¶us
was no happy man.</p>

<p>He may, of course, have experienced a certain degree
of delight or happiness while he was so busily
occupied in making money and in forging ahead
until he reached the very top of the publicans' ladder;
now, however, when he had accomplished all
that&mdash;he was not happy, at all.</p>

<p>How could that be?</p>

<p>I believe at that time perhaps he <i>had lived his
life outside himself, as it were, and been wholly
absorbed by his official duties</i>. But now that he
found time to be home by himself, and to be occupied
with the inner world of his soul, he heard
in there an accusing voice which told him: <i>You are
a sinful man, Zacch√¶us!</i> And the man who is
sinful, is not happy.</p>

<p>What should he do?</p>

<p>He might devote himself once more to the <i>mania
for gathering wealth</i>, might thrust himself energetically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
back into the work. Or he might devote
himself to the merry <i>life of society</i>&mdash;seek pleasures,
the remedy which the world offers to those who are
afflicted with wounded souls. But in both cases he
would once more be forced to live his life outside
himself. He did not like that. It would be too
much like taking flight from oneself.</p>

<p>But there was a third way&mdash;<i>that of the repenting
sinner</i>. He chose that. People referred to him by
calling him a <i>sinful man</i>, and sighingly he had to
admit that the people were right. He understood
that now since he was home by himself&mdash;O, could
but his sin be stricken out!</p>

<p>Now there was this Man, Jesus of Nazareth!
Wasn't He the same one whom John the Baptist
had spoken of as the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world? And was not He the
same one who had said to a poor fellow sick of the
palsy: "Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
thee!" If he might only see Him!</p>

<p>Suddenly streets resounded with the cry: Jesus
of Nazareth is coming! Zacch√¶us got busy, ran
on ahead and climbed unto a tree. Hidden by the
dense leafage there, he would have a chance of seeing
Jesus&mdash;why, He is coming right there&mdash;He
actually stops at the tree, looks up, sees him, and
says: "Zacch√¶us, make haste, and come down;
for today I must abide by thy house!" And he
made haste, and came down, and received Him joyfully.
And when they saw it, they all murmured,
saying that He was gone to be guest with a man
that is a sinner. But Zacch√¶us stood, and said
unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything
from any man by false accusation, I restore him
fourfold. And Jesus said unto him: This day is
salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also
is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man is come
to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>

<p>He was son of Abraham!</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>As Abraham had learned how to be home by himself
and to say, "I am but dust and ashes"&mdash;thus
Zacch√¶us had come home to himself when he realized
that he was a sinner. And as Abraham was
willing to sacrifice his son, his heart's treasure,
thus Zacch√¶us had come to the point where he
was willing to sacrifice half of what was his&mdash;that
dear, dear property which his heart had loved
so fervently and to which it had been attached for
many years. That had been the most precious
treasure of his heart.</p>

<p><i>To be home by oneself humbles.</i> <i>To live outside
oneself makes haughty</i>, and God is displeased
with those who are haughty while He bestows His
grace on those who are humble.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>"For today I must abide by thy house," Jesus
says.</p>

<p>Why? Because Zacch√¶us could be found at
home. Jesus always knocks on the doors of those
hearts where He knows He finds someone at home.
He must abide there.</p>

<p>To the men of our own age the danger of living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
outside themselves in their work and business, is
great. Our age suffers from a tension which was
not known in bygone days. If a man is to surge
ahead, he must let his business absorb his entire
strength. Therefore, it is so difficult for Jesus
to find men at home when He knocks at the door
of their heart, and therefore so few men are to be
found in the church on the Lord's day. Women are
not in the same measure tempted to live their lives
outside themselves.</p>

<p>But Zacch√¶us stands like one who admonishes
the man of our age: <i>Try to be at home by yourself,
in your own soul. That is the road you must
wander if you are to find happiness.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>All Forgiven&mdash;Nothing In Vain</i></div>

<p>"This day is salvation come to this house." To
Zacch√¶us this means: <i>Your sin has been forgiven&mdash;all
has been stricken out</i>.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Funcke relates how he on a certain
occasion called upon Dr. K√∂gel in Berlin&mdash;a man
who was paralyzed and unable to move. He pitied
Dr. K√∂gel&mdash;regretted that this man, formerly so
stately and erect, should sit thus crouching, but Dr.
K√∂gel said: "Rejoice with me&mdash;God hath forgiven
all my sins!"</p>

<p>In a cemetery in Southern Germany there are
two tombstones with strange inscriptions; one reads:
<i>Forgiven!</i> and the other, <i>In Vain!</i></p>

<p>Beneath the former rests the dust of a woman
who through her extraordinary beauty fascinated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
number of admirers. They seduced her, made her
run away from her husband and children, and when
once she had entered the life of immorality, she
went swiftly down the grade. She developed into a
criminal and was imprisoned. In the penitentiary
she came home by herself, and here Jesus found
her. When she left the institution, she went back
to her husband and children and proved a blessing
to her home; as a humble, Christian woman she
did not spare herself for the sake of those whom
she loved. But when death drew near, she asked
them to inscribe upon her tombstone that one word,
Forgiven! This word was a world to her, was
everything. Her sin forgiven by God, forgiven by
mankind.</p>

<p>Yes, when <i>everything is forgiven</i> we can rejoice
at being home by ourselves. But we need still one
thing more before our joy is perfect. We want to
be told <i>that we have not lived in vain</i>.</p>

<p>Zacch√¶us knows how to appreciate salvation. In
proof of his gratitude he gives half of his goods to
the poor. It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Formerly he had felt a certain joy whenever
he could add a sum of a hundred to his fortune&mdash;but
how paltry that joy was compared to the joy of
giving! That could not possibly have been done in
vain.</p>

<p>Jesus said to His disciples: And whosoever shall
give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of
cold water only, verily I say unto you, he shall in
no wise lose his reward. No offering of thanks for
salvation is in vain. It brings bliss. It will get
its reward&mdash;from the greatest offer of thanks which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
we can afford to give, down to the smallest&mdash;a
kind word, a friendly clasping of hands, a cup of
cold water. Nothing of all this shall be in vain.
But he who lives outside himself, absorbed by the
cravings for ever more riches, lives in vain even
though he may become a millionaire.</p>

<p>Are you not in need of having written above all
of your life and all your doings that one great word,
<i>Forgiven!</i> And are you not in need of being assured
that you have not <i>lived in vain</i>? You may
not have been able to bring the magnificent sacrifices
which the world lauds in the newspaper columns,
and you may easily be led into the belief that you
have lived in vain; but then you shall know that
the Lord who is the King of Kings and the Judge
of all and everything, will reward also that which
looks insignificant and small in the eyes of the
world. Nothing of that which you do as His disciple,
is done in vain.</p>

<p>Above the life of the children of the world one
might place the inscription: <i>Nothing forgiven&mdash;everything
in vain!</i> Above the lives of Christians:
<i>Everything forgiven&mdash;nothing in vain</i>.</p>

<p>Isn't that so, then: Christians have glorious
days!</p>

<p><i>What terms do you choose?</i></p>


<div class='center'><br />3. <i>During the Following Days</i></div>

<p>It was a day of joy to Zacch√¶us when Jesus
entered his house. But how were the following
days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly there were days when the old greediness
tempted him again. When the people of Israel
in a miraculous way had been helped across the Red
Sea, they were saved from the armed hosts of the
Egyptians, but not from their plagues. The Egyptian
soldiers had been drowned in the waves of the
Red Sea, but the Egyptian temptations accompanied
Israel across the sea and made the wanderings in
the desert beset with hardships and difficulties.
Indeed, they often, in their worldly hearts, reverted
to the thought: <i>Would it not, after all, have been
better to return and to partake of the plentiful provisions
of Egypt than to fight their way laboriously
onward to the promised land?</i></p>

<p>Likewise the tempter undoubtedly has often whispered
to Zacch√¶us: After all, wouldn't it have been
wiser to <i>gather money than to give it away</i> as an
offering in return for salvation? But then Zacch√¶us
in his mind reverted to that great day when
Jesus for the first time was a guest in his house,
and his thoughts have lived that day over and over
again&mdash;No, never was I as happy as on the day
when I gave half of my goods to the poor, and never
have I been able to make as many people happy as on
that day. The offering had not been given in vain.
So the old greediness had to yield to the benevolent
impulse.</p>

<p>But that very same thought may come to you and
me: Wouldn't it, after all, be wiser to get a lot
of money together than to give it away in the name
of the Lord to mission work, to churches and
schools, to the poor, the sick and the suffering?</p>

<p>No! And once again: No! For that person in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
whose heart greediness has triumphed, has lived in
vain even though he may have gathered thousands
of dollars. He has contributed to the increase of
the <i>lifeless capital of mankind, but not to its joy
of living, to its happiness</i>. But he or she who
brings offerings in the name of Jesus, increases the
joy of living and happiness of mankind by just that
much. Perhaps he has struggled along laboriously
to reach the promised land of joy and happiness.
His life has attained a meaning both to himself and
to others&mdash;and he has not lived in vain.</p>

<h2>THE MARCH OF EVENTS</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Lu.</span> 24, 29)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"ABIDE with us; for it is toward evening, and
the day is far spent."</div>

<p>Thus the two disciples spoke to Jesus in the afternoon
of Easter Sunday when they were at the village
called Emmaus. The march of events on Good
Friday had excited them greatly: Should really
the powers of evil vanquish even Him of whom they
had expected that He would redeem Israel? This
thought was so utterly distressing. And what would
happen to themselves? For also within their hearts
evil had a firm hold, and they were not able to conquer
it.</p>

<p>Thinking along these lines the two disciples
walked toward Emmaus. It was as though the
heart would be crushed under the weight of the
events, but then Jesus came, and He told them that
the march of events was not a series of sad and distressing
<i>chances</i>. It behooved Christ to suffer and
then to assume His glory. This was felt as a relief.</p>

<p>Was this, too, <i>planned</i> by the God of Israel?</p>

<p>They were not quite able to comprehend it.
Neither did they know who was speaking to them;
but when they were at Emmaus and He made as if
to go on, they implored Him: "Abide with us; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it is toward evening, and the day is far spent!"
It was such a comfort to listen to His words. In
them was that healing power which crushed hearts
needed&mdash;O, would He but tarry with them!</p>

<p>So He went inside with them, and when He broke
the bread, their eyes were opened, and they saw it
was Jesus Himself&mdash;that very same Jesus whom
they had believed perished under the burden of the
events of Good Friday.</p>

<p>Then they did rejoice.</p>

<div class='center'><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></div>

<p>Yes, Lord, abide with us; for it is toward evening,
and the day is far spent!</p>

<p>Let us first of all think of our own <i>life-day</i>.
None of us knows how nigh is the evening. We
may be near the final hour, both you and I, even
though our hair as yet has no silver tinge. And if
we, with this possibility in view, review the march
of events in our own lives, we see much which we
would like to change&mdash;if we but could. How often
have not the powers of evil been victorious in our
lives, as they were on that Good Friday! That
thought grips the heart wistfully. And a little way
ahead: That dark power death&mdash;"the difficult
death" as a modern writer has said. O, how intensely
we wish that so many things could be
thought over and lived over once more!</p>

<p>But when we thus review the march of events in
our own life, we sigh: "Hearest thou also us, thou
Son of Grace!" For the only one who can relieve
our suffering is Jesus Christ; His abiding by us as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the <i>Son of Grace</i> is the great surcease, for He comes
from Heaven with grace enough with which to
cover all our shortcomings, all our sins, and with
healing for all those wounds which have been inflicted
upon us in the course of the march of events.
It is, indeed, a blessing to know that just what we
are yearning for from the very depth of our soul
is what He rejoices most in giving us. We shall
not pray in vain.</p>

<p>But it was not only what we had thought and
what we had done. There was so much in the
march of events which was sad and incomprehensible.
Was that an evil power which from without,
by chance, disrupted our life? Was it a series of
happenings without aim, without meaning? In that
case we stand in need of listening to the words of
Jesus: It behooves you to suffer this, and then to
enter into My glory. The saddest events in our
earthly life are like dark viaducts which lead us
forward to glory. They, too, lead us to salvation.
It is relieving when this becomes quite clear to us.
We feel like the disciples when listening to the
words of the Lord: There is comfort and healing
in them. And then we can rejoice even though it is
toward evening. We have no fear, we shudder not,
at the thought that <i>the end of the day</i> is drawing
nigh&mdash;for that draws us closer to the glory, and
death will be the last dark passage through which
we must wend our way.</p>

<p>But if we look round about us it seems to me that
it is toward evening for <i>this world</i>. The end of
the long day of the life of the world is drawing
nigh, and by the words of the Lord we know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the march of events in the last days will not be
cheerful for the Christians. The powers of evil
shall arise against the Lord and His church, just as
they did during that Easter week, and they will
unite in one final outburst of desperate strength for
the purpose of conquering. Then it will be seen
decisively once more that the church is fighting principalities
and powers, the masters of the world, and
the spiritual hosts under the sky. The bow will be
bent for this final struggle&mdash;and the world already
now is singing a hymn of victory.</p>

<p>What shall we do?</p>

<p>We can change the march of events as little as
could those early disciples. We may try a struggle
as did Peter at Gethsemane&mdash;may perhaps even
inflict a small wound on someone, but in our use of
the sword there is no prospect of victory. We must
have Him with us who on that Shrove Thursday
spoke to the henchmen of wickedness with such
might that they fell to the ground at the very sound
of His words. Therefore, we are in need of praying,
Abide with us, Lord, not only as the Son of
Grace, but as the <i>Lord of Strength</i>&mdash;indeed, as the
Lord of Strength we need Him when we survey
the march of events in the world.</p>

<p>As little as at that time is He now powerless.
But as it behooved Him to suffer these things and
then enter into glory, so it also behooves His church
during the last ages to bear those sufferings which
the march of events carries in its wake, and then
enter into glory; but, the Lord of Strength will
shorten those last days (Mat. 24, 22). Here it is
once more true that these events are not so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sad accidents and painful happenings of chance without
aim or meaning. No, they, too, must be made
to serve the reign of the Lord, and to help the
church on its road to glory. <i>But only the Lord of
Strength is able to make the events work together
in unison, under all circumstances, for the purpose
of our sanctification.</i> Only He can make dusk of
the evening change into dawn for His church.</p>

<p>Therefore, we pray: "Abide with us; for it is
toward evening, and the day is far spent." Yea,
abidest thou with us as the <i>Son of Grace</i> and as <i>the
Lord of Strength</i> during the march of events, and
assurest thou us more and more that no one is able
to tear us away from thy hand! Assurest us that
even the very darkest, the most distressing events,
whether they affect the individual or the church in
general, are merely dark passages which, through
thy strength and grace, shall lead us forward to
peace and joy, to eternal life and everlasting blessedness.
Then we shall rejoice during the march of
events.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE WHILE</h2>

<div class='center'><i>Its Significance to the Life of Christians</i><br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT was during Easter week that Jesus spoke the
word about the little while in which the disciples
were not to see Him, and in which they would be
brought to the very brink of despair while the
world enjoyed itself in a fleeting exuberance of
victory. The little while with its deep, its hopeless
sorrow lasted for the disciples from Good Friday
until Easter Sunday, and, forsooth, their weeping
was heartrending, their plaints most gripping. Jesus
had been taken away from them, and they did not
understand that it behooved Him to suffer this and
then to enter into glory; nor did they realize that
they would themselves, in a little while, be mature,
so as to win the world for the Lord who now had
been nailed onto a cross.</div>

<p>Darkness enveloped the earth for three hours so
the rays of the sun were unable to penetrate it;
but still denser was the spiritual darkness which had
gathered about the disciples: There was no glimpse
of light, no hope! For He who, as they had hoped,
was to have redeemed Israel, had breathed His last
on the cross. The words of the Lord were literally
fulfilled upon them; they wept and lamented. At
this moment they were unable to cling to the promise
of the Lord: "I will see you again, and your heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you."</p>

<p>But were we able at this moment to see the apostles
before us and to ask them: What do you think
of the brief hours of despair in your lives&mdash;and
especially of that which was the most sorrowful of
all? I am certain they would answer: It was, indeed,
a most significant "little while," and all the
brief moments of despair throughout life have been
so valuable that we could not have done without
them. But if this were so, as far as the apostles
were concerned, then it must be the same for us, and
with this in view we will ask:</p>

<p><i>What, then, is the meaning of the distressful
"little whiles" to the life of Christians?</i> Those
dark and burdensome hours when the tears moisten
our eyes; and darkness gathers about our souls;
those hours which we would rather be without but
which we can so ill afford to dispense with. I might
answer quite briefly thus: <i>It is during those moments
that we are moulded by the hands of the
Father as the children of light!</i> I know for a certainty
that it was during just such moments that I
became a servant of the Lord wishing from out of
the depth of my soul to find the way from the evil
world of deceit and darkness homeward to the
eternal abodes of light. Therefore I thank the Lord
also for those dark hours which came into my life,
and therefore I by no means praise that man or
woman happy who has known no such moments, but
I do think he or she who has struggled through
them to peace and rejoicing is happy.</p>

<p>In order to understand fully the meaning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sad moments in the life of mankind, we will recall
a few of the great men of God.</p>

<p>David was named the man according to the
heart of God. But was he made that when he
reached the highest pinnacle of his power and glory
and when he with regal strength ruled the subdued
neighboring nations?</p>

<p>I hardly think so.</p>

<p>It was rather during those bitter hours when he,
weeping and bare-foot, was forced to flee before his
own son, or when he with his heart writhing in
anguish prayed: "Create in me a clean heart, O
God, and renew a right spirit within me!" It was
during such moments when he crouched in humiliation
that he became disgusted with deceit and falsity,
with the doings of darkness and the evil lust of the
flesh. It was in such moments that he learned
how to yearn from the depths of his heart for life
itself: "Where thoughts are pure and deeds are unblemished."</p>

<p>When Peter had denied his Lord and Saviour
thrice in the courtyard of the high priest and was
standing without, bitter and heavy tears rolled down
his cheeks; never in his life had Peter detested that
denial as he did just then. How hideous it looked
to him&mdash;to have denied Jesus! Undoubtedly he was
thinking by himself: O, could I but find an opportunity
of proclaiming Him once more&mdash;then I
should do it with all the strength and sincerity of
my heart.</p>

<p>Or Thomas! We know that after hearing the
testimony of the resurrection of Jesus he said: "Except
I shall see in His hands the print of the nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and put my finger into the print of the nails, and
thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe."
Then, when he sees Jesus again and hears His
gently reproachful, "Blessed are they that have not
seen, and yet have believed"&mdash;how Thomas must
have been disgusted with his infidelity, and how he
must have reproached himself because he had invited
the evil power of doubt and unbelief into his
soul. That was to happen nevermore!</p>

<p>These heavy hours were changed into rejoicing for
such men. And it is the testimony of all men and
women who have been blessed by the special grace
of God that such "little whiles" have meant much
to the development of their lives by giving it <i>direction,
depth and sincerity</i>.</p>

<p>But how about you? Have you had similar experiences?</p>

<p>Many of you probably will say: We know the
hours of distress&mdash;we also know how deeply depressing
they may be. Even though we may not
have wept and lamented, like the first disciples, because
of the scorn and ridicule by the world, we
often have shed tears that betrayed the presence of
a wounded heart. But we did not go farther in
our understanding of the meaning of the sorrowful
moments. We have felt their pressure, but we
have lost sight of their blessedness; we have been
unable to discover the gain which they mean to our
lives.</p>

<p>Look to the depths of your own soul and then tell
me: Do you not feel the hidden connection between
the sin, as it had attained power in your soul, and
the pressure of the brief, sorrow-laden moments?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Have you not also in such moments felt a truer, a
more sincere and deeper disgust with the evil character
of sin, than otherwise? Did not that wish
soar upward from the very bottom of your soul:
Would I were relieved of all that is evil so that I
might live with "all my thoughts pure, and all my
deeds unblemished"?</p>

<p>But if you have felt this, then you already are
somewhat conscious of the blessedness of the moments
of distress, for that is what is asked of us
first of all. Without disgust with the evil being of
sin we cannot renounce the devil and all his works
and all his ways.</p>

<p>But is that all to which the brief, sorrow-laden
moments can guide and help us? No&mdash;the faith of
the disciples was strengthened during the little
while. It is true that their faith wavered in that
while, and that it looked as though it would collapse,
but <i>this was not the agony of death, but the
pangs of birth</i>.</p>

<p>Hitherto they had been accustomed to seeing
Jesus and then believing in Him. Now <i>that</i> faith
was to be born which would cling to him through
His word without seeing Him. During the little
while it looked as though Jesus had suffered defeat
and the world had conquered. But after the resurrection
the disciples saw the meaning of it all:
Jesus had taken death upon Himself not because He
was vanquished but because the Father, in His unfathomable
wisdom and His eternal love, had thus
decided it for the purpose of salvation.</p>

<p>They knew now that no matter how discouraging
the outlook might be, no matter how loudly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
world might proclaim its victory&mdash;His word was to
be depended upon. And firm in this faith they
went out to conquer the world for Jesus Christ
after having received the spirit from Above. Often
it looked to them as it did on Good Friday, but instead
of weeping and lamenting they sang hymns of
praise to the Lord fully convinced that He was the
strongest. Their faith had been strengthened so as
to bear the resistance of the world, and rejoicing
had taken up its everlasting abode in their hearts.
<i>The little while had been the hour of birth of the
faith which was to conquer all the world, and gain
the eternal state of blessedness.</i></p>

<p>Thus the little dark moments have a meaning in
the lives of Christians, aside from filling us with
detestation of the evil ways of sin. They must
be hours of birth through which our faith shall
emerge renewed and invigorated until it appears as
that firm faith which wins the great victory over the
world.</p>

<p>And if there is anything of which we stand in
need, in addition to being filled with horror at the
phantoms of deceit, the evil ways of darkness&mdash;it is
the firm faith and the eternal joy of blessedness
which give us strength to become more and more
the children of God, immaculate before His face,
and by which we can be easily recognized as children
of light in a world darkened by sin.</p>

<p>The world still rejoices and still&mdash;after a struggle
of almost two thousand years&mdash;thinks it shall
conquer the church of the Lord. Now and then we
are told that in another hundred years Christianity
will be something entirely different, adjusted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
trend of thought&mdash;or that it will have lost all its
strength. When we face this haughty scorn of the
world, we need the firm belief that although the
world thinks it will triumph, it will still collapse.
For the Lord is Almighty: The great powerful
world will never be able to remain longer, or to
progress farther, than He permits.</p>

<p>Then there is the joy which no one can take
away from us. It is the joy of blessedness in which
all the sorrows of life vanish, just as the pangs of
birth are lost in the exuberant joy of the thought
that a new human being has been brought into the
world. It is with the joy of blessedness as with
maternal love: It is made through travail and suffering,
and no one can take it away from us!</p>

<p>Ah, how it irritated and angered Jews and
heathen when they were unable to deprive the ancient
Christians of this joy even in the moment of
death! When Stephen appeared before the council,
and his face was like the face of an angel because
the joy of Heaven reposed within his soul&mdash;they
cut to the heart and they gnashed with their teeth,
cast him out of the city, and stoned him. But his
joy they could not take away from him: Would
that this might abide among us in greater fullness,
for it is that very joy which gives us the touch of
gentleness, mildness and loveliness!</p>

<p>The Christian may say about the "little whiles"
that are full of vexation, what Joseph said to his
brethren: "God made everything right in order to
do what He now hath done, and to preserve life."
The "little whiles" may be heavy with trouble and
sorrow, but it is an irremovable truth in the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the Lord that He changes them into good purposes
in order to preserve our lives.</p>

<p>It must have been difficult for the disciples to understand
the Lord's word about the "little while"&mdash;and
it is difficult for us amidst our adversity to absorb
thoroughly the fact that God will turn our
sorrow into joy&mdash;that, forsooth, sorrow itself is
pregnant with joy, shall become joy, and that these
"little whiles" are necessary to the development and
the ripening of the Christian life. It was only when
the disciples had lived through the little while and
seen the Lord once more that they understood His
words. So also with us. The dark "little whiles"
in our life are to be read&mdash;like the Hebraic scriptures&mdash;backward.
Only when we have lived
through these dark moments and when joy has found
anew the way to our hearts, are we beginning to
realize their meaning.</p>

<p><i>They were hours of redemption and hours of

<h2>THE MIRACLE IN OUR AGE</h2>

<div class='center'>(<span class="smcap">Acts</span> 26, 8)<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE miracle!</div>

<p>Well, who believes in it nowadays? If it had
been five hundred years ago, it might have been different,
but in our educated age&mdash;no, we know better
now! Science has spoken with the assurance of an
expert and said: No miracles happen! Everything
adheres to certain stringent laws; our researches
have proved this, and the miracle has never existed
except in the brains of undeveloped ignorant individuals.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we maintain in the church of the
Lord that the miracle is a fact&mdash;as concrete a reality
as was&mdash;the French revolution. The miracle does
not thrive on the recognition of science, nor does it
collapse before the shots which science fires against
it. But when we maintain this, some people pityingly
shrug their shoulders or smile haughtily while
they sneer: How backward you people are! You
certainly are not well posted in regard to the development
and the intelligence of the age.</p>

<p>Let us see if speech of this kind cannot be effectively
met so that we as Christians may retain
our faith and still be developed and intelligent
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />1. <i>The Miracle and Nature</i></div>

<p>If we ask infidel science how everything originated,
it answers: <i>Through evolution!</i> The world
has developed during millions of years. But if we
ask further: Whence and from what? You yourselves
claim that <i>nothing originates in nothing</i>, then
this world must, according to your own postulates,
have originated in something, for your own fundamental
claim is that it cannot have risen out of
nothingness.</p>

<p>To this the general answer is that perhaps there
was a small beginning, a protoplasm from which all
things grew. But if there has been such a protoplasm,
it certainly is an unprecedented miracle.
Never at any later time has anyone beheld such a
protoplasm through which an entire world arose, and
in that case <i>all existence is based upon a miracle</i>.
This has only been assigned to as remote a time as
possible, and even though one had not freed himself
of the miracle, it was not irritatingly present as a
constant probability in the evolution of the world.
For, to admit that an Almighty God created everything
from the very beginning is synonymous with
admitting the fact of the miracle as a constant probability.
It is impossible for us to conceive that the
Almighty at the time of the Creation should have
so exhausted His powers that He now faces His
creations as one who is utterly powerless. If His
omnipotence made all things, then He must still
be able, through that very omnipotence, to interfere,
to mend and to increase, because in His wisdom He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
realizes that it so serves the promotion of his eternal
plans.</p>

<p>Yes, but the <i>miracle is contrary to nature</i>, it is
said.</p>

<p>Let us see! When Jesus at the marriage at Cana
in Galilee turned water into wine, a miracle happened,
and many believed in Him.</p>

<p><i>Water into wine!</i> Is that really contrary to nature?
Is it not the very same thing that happens
in nature every summer when the water of the soil
is absorbed into the tender roots of the vine and
passes through its branches, finally becoming wine
in the grapes? The turning of water into wine is
no change which rests upon violation of the laws
of nature. In nature this happens in accordance
with those plans which are the guiding laws of the
powers of nature. At Cana in Galilee it happened
in another way, but the same thing was accomplished:
Water became wine! There is unity in
the achievement. Is there not also an inner harmony
between the powers working according to
plans and laws in nature, and those which work
untrammeled through the miracle? I think that we
here are facing a unity in those powers&mdash;a relationship
as intimate as between the Father and His only
begotten Son who rests in His arms. And when
we witness other miracles in which this unity becomes
invisible to us, I certainly do not think it is
because the unity is absent, but just because we are
too shortsighted to perceive it. But then the miracle
is, after all, not contrary to nature when looked at
profoundly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But the miracle is in conflict with the <i>immutable
laws</i> of nature, it is said.</p>

<p>Let us mention an instance. I fetch a silver dollar
and throw it up in the air. According to the
law of gravity, which is one of the immutable laws
of nature, it falls toward the ground, but by a firm
resolve and by the strength in my arm I may catch
it and hold it in the air.</p>

<p>What happens then? Is the law of nature violated,
or is it rendered ineffective? By no means!
But another unit of power appears which in this case
is strong enough to hold the dollar in the air in
spite of the fact that the law of nature acts upon
it with its power in order to lead it earthwards.
By my firm resolve and by the strength in my arm
something else happens than if I had not interfered.</p>

<p>Yes, you say, such an insignificant thing as a coin
anyone may keep in the air. It is different when we
speak about the immense system of the universe.
But&mdash;do you know whether or not the entire universe
with its countless astral bodies weigh more in
the hands of the Almighty than a silver dollar in
mine? I do not believe it. Then, what you and I
may do on a small scale, God Almighty may do on
the larger scale without annihilating the laws of nature.
They act as usual, each according to its own
plan, but God Almighty may interfere and cause
that something else will happen than would otherwise
have happened, in spite of the fact that the
laws of nature retain their entire power.</p>

<p>Finally it is said that miracle is contrary to <i>our
experience</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us imagine an old sailor a couple of hundred
years ago. Through more than a generation he had
steered his vessel sometimes aided by wind and currents,
sometimes against them. If he were told that
a ship might be steered straight against the wind
and the currents without sails, without cruising,
without oar strokes, he would have uttered a fierce
sailors' oath that such a story was a lie&mdash;wild imagination!
No, he knew by <i>experience</i> what was the
power of the wind and the currents, and he had been
struggling ever so gallantly against those very powers
of the sea&mdash;no, no&mdash;don't tell me stories like
that! You may be able to find some unexperienced
people who will believe tales of that kind, but I
know better.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we all know nowadays that the proud
vessels sail steadily against wind and currents without
canvas sails, without cruising man&#339;uvres and
without oar strokes. What is the reason for this?
Are wind and currents adhering to other laws in
our days, or has their effect been changed? No,
not at all! But the old salt thought that his experience
was exhaustive in this special field. It all required
a power which he did not know, and in whose
existence he did not believe.</p>

<p>The attitude of the unbelieving science in our
age toward the miracle is exactly like this. It has
emitted many a droll sailor's oath to affirm that
the miracle is contrary to its experience&mdash;and with
the very same justification as did the sailor. We
all need being reminded that human experience is
very, very limited. It embraces such a small fraction
of the universe, and it is not inclined to concede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
its limitations. The handicap of science is that of
the sailor. In order to steer his ship right against
wind and currents a power was required which he
did not know and in whose existence he would not
believe. In order to let the miracle happen, a power
is required of which science, as such, does not know
and in whose existence it refuses to believe.</p>

<p>How many unbelieving physicians have not sworn
as drastically as did the sailor, that they could not
share the Christian faith in resurrection? The
physician says like the sailor: I know better&mdash;don't
tell me stories! I have seen too often how that
pumping machinery in the human body which is
called heart, comes to a stop, and when the heart
ceases beating, the eye is extinguished, and the body
approaches the process of dissolution. Don't tell
me anything about the resurrection of the dead. It
is contrary to my experience.&mdash;And yet, all that is
required in order to make this possible, is a power
which he does not know, and in whose existence he
will not believe.</p>

<p>He who was powerful enough to turn dust into
man from the beginning, certainly is powerful
enough to revivify that dust.</p>

<p>The existence of this power is recognized, and has
been experienced, in the church of the Lord. But,
here we stop by asserting that <i>that miracle in nature
means that God works in other ways than those
determined by the plans and laws of nature</i>. It is
the very same power of God that works through the
miracle as through nature restrained by laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>The Miracle and the Church of the Lord</i></div>

<p>If, then, we leave the sphere of nature for that of
the church to seek an expression of the power which
is working here, we find one formed by Paul the
apostle: <i>The power of the resurrection of Jesus
Christ</i>.</p>

<p>But as God's power in nature chiefly acts according
to certain laws and plans, unheeding them only
now and then&mdash;so does the power of His Son in the
church. It acts regularly, determined by laws and
order, and unrestrained only now and then. In this
there is, in both cases, a very great blessedness to be
found. We have been created to abide by conditions
which are determined by well-defined plans
and laws, and we would be seriously troubled by
being the objects of merely arbitrary and unrestrained
powers.</p>

<p>When Jesus made bread for the hungry multitude
in the desert, it happened through the free interference
of powers&mdash;not in accordance with accepted
laws and plans. But now suppose that the farmer
were to expect bread in this manner&mdash;that certainly
would lead him into a painful state of doubt: He
had not sown his seed in the spring, for he was sure
a miracle would be wrought so that the crop would
be ready by harvest time. Summer elapsed and he
looked anxiously for the miracle which was to bring
him the crop. According to the ways of human
thinking it lasted too long before the miracle happened!
What painful restlessness and uncertainty!
No, there is greater surety and satisfaction in the
order predicated upon laws, that seedtime and harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shall not cease, and that whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he reap.</p>

<p>But as God thus has endowed nature with His
power so as to make it adopt certain laws with the
end in view that man's worldly existence shall be
based thereon, so Christ has endowed His church
with the power of resurrection which works through
His institutions according to laws, and <i>upon this
action, regulated and determined by laws, rests the
existence of Christians</i>. By doing so He has not,
however, exhausted Himself or confined Himself so
as to make it impossible for Him to work through
other methods, but we are restrained even as are
those means through which the power of His resurrection
comes to us.</p>

<p>It would be wrong on the part of the farmer to
demand that bread should be made in any other
way than that which God has designed for its production
from the soil&mdash;and it would be just as
wrong on the part of Christians to demand miracles.
We must abide by the church <i>in which the power of
the resurrection of Jesus Christ acts, regulated and
law-restrained, at the baptismal font and communion,
upon all those who will choose the right
attitude toward them</i>.</p>

<p>But has not the miracle, this unrestrained action
of the powers, disappeared from the church? Miracles
do not happen nowadays as in the time of the
apostles.</p>

<p>People are often heard to speak like this, and here
we must first of all call attention to the fact that
one period in the history of the church may be profuse
in miracles while the other is devoid of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
It does not go according to our desires and thoughts,
but according to what the Lord in His wisdom
deems well for the fulfillment of His eternal
thoughts. Furthermore, our age is not in a very receptive
mood for the "miracle"&mdash;it might face <i>the
strange things</i> gapingly instead of believingly accepting
the "miracle" as a "miracle" and give God
the glory therefor. Yet I am convinced that the unrestrained
interference of powers has not ceased in
our age, but it takes place only according to the
counsel of the Lord, and where receptivity is present.
Nowadays, this applies especially in heathen
lands and in secret where the faithful pray and receive
unseen by the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>But, in this connection, I would call attention to
the following: The greatest miracle is not that
some sick person may be restored to health, or freed
of some bodily weakness, but that <i>I, the sinner that
I am, may be resurrected in spirit, soul and body,
in accordance with the eternal thoughts of glory of
God</i>. This miracle is a thousand times greater
than that which took place at the door of the temple
when Peter said to him who was lame from his
mother's womb: "Rise up and walk!" For this
does not apply to a certain part of the body nor to
certain bodily weaknesses, but to <i>the entire being
with all its weaknesses</i>. This is the greatest miracle
of all, and it takes place until the very end of time
within the church of the Lord.</p>

<p>Here we truly have reason for saying: Praise
be to God that we are not expected to look for the
unrestrained interference of the powers for the sake
of the restitution of our entire being, but that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
can adhere to the regulated, law-restrained acts of
the powers, fully convinced that the good work
which is thus begun shall be completed in this manner,
in spite of the devil and in spite of death.</p>

<p>The power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
does not work here in the same way as in the case
of the resurrection of Lazarus; for there it acted
unrestrainedly and visibly, even to the unbelieving
Jewish people. Here it works invisibly, but none
the less tangibly, and a far greater goal is to be
attained. I am not to be resurrected like Lazarus to
once more live under conditions of sin, and to once
more face death. I am to be resurrected from death
and from the conditions of sin wholly prepared to be
at home in the halls of Heaven. In order to achieve
this I am not to look for <i>sensations</i> and <i>movements</i>
in bluish dimness, but to adhere faithfully to
the regulated, law-restrained acts of the powers
within the church of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is in the faith in this action of the powers that
we are, with Paul the apostle, to look forward to
the resurrection of all things. I do not think that
through the power of the resurrection of Jesus
Christ all things are to be restored to the extent,
as some have thought, that even the devil himself
is to enter into the kingdom of God and become
a leader of angels as he had been before; nor do
I think that the godless and the infidels will be
placed among the Godfearing and the faithful in
the Kingdom of Heaven without repentance and
faith. But I do believe for a certainty that all
things are to be restored according to the eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
design of God in which the power of the resurrection
of Jesus Christ is allowed to act. And for
that we are yearning within the church.</p>

<p>But nature also yearns; that, too, is subject to
corruption. That, too, shall be freed of the thraldom
of corruption into the glorious freedom of the
children of God. When the power of the resurrection
of Jesus Christ has penetrated nature, then
it will appear as the new earth in which justice
abideth. But just as man must pass through death,
through perdition, humanly seen, so the ancient
earth must pass through death and perdition, and
the scripture testifies with equal firmness in the
case of both, that man must die and the earth must
perish.</p>

<p>Then the great miracle has happened that everywhere
in the life of man and in nature where the
power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is working,
the restoration of all things has taken place,
and the rest has been completely segregated from
us so that it no longer may tempt or ensnare us.
All bonds have broken. The miracle has been
accomplished in its entire extent in accordance with
the counsel of the wisdom of God&mdash;that miracle
which was begun when the only begotten Son of
God was conceived by a woman&mdash;that miracle
which, as far as you are concerned, took place
when He was conceived within you at the sacred
moment of baptism.</p>

<p>It is said about the miracle of Jesus at Cana that
it was a <i>token</i>, and that may be said about all the
miracles of the Lord. But, of what are they tokens?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Of the fact that His power can conquer everywhere,
<i>in nature, in the life of mankind, and in the
spiritual world</i>.</p>

<p>Tokens of His mastery of nature were witnessed
at the marriage at Cana where He turned water
into wine; when He stilled the storm on Gennesaret
lake; and when He filled the nets of the
fishermen: In the life of mankind when blind
became seeing; deaf became hearing; the lame
walked and the dead arose: In the spiritual world
when Jesus drove the evil spirits away from those
who had become obsessed by them&mdash;indeed, even
the prince of the evil spirits, the devil, was forced
to yield defeated. All these are tokens that the
power of Jesus Christ can do everything, can master
anything from the deep of the sea to the highest
arch of the sky, and that it is capable of attaining
victory in the struggle with principalities and
powers, with the spiritual hosts of evil beneath the
sky.</p>

<p>But these tokens, furthermore, are <i>small beginnings
of the restoration</i> and when they have been
perfected, everywhere and all-inclusive, then that
new Heaven and that new earth where justice dwelleth,
has become a fact.</p>

<p>God is the God of order. Therefore we find
plans, system and laws in nature as well as in the
church. It has been given especially to our own
age to realize this so that an expression like "the
law of nature in the spiritual world" has been
recognized. Science has perceived this regulated,
law-restrained order of things in nature as keenly
as never before, but, alas, it became dizzy thereat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Otherwise it would have exclaimed even as Paul
did: O, world of wisdom and power! Who would
have known how to plan thus? Who would have
the strength to subdue and master the giant powers?</p>

<p>In the church of the Lord we respond: <i>God the
Almighty Father, the creator of Heaven and earth!</i></p>

<p>An atheist was lecturing at a village in England
and ended by self-confidently inviting the audience
to take part in a discussion.</p>

<p>Then an old woman, her back bent with the
weariness of life and years, arose, saying:</p>

<p>"Sir, I have a question to ask you?"</p>

<p>"All right, my good woman," the atheist answered,
"what is it then?"</p>

<p>"Ten years ago I was left a widow with eight
unsupported children. I had nothing but a Bible,
but by following its directions and by believing in
God I have been enabled to support my dear ones
and myself. I am now approaching the grave, but
I am perfectly happy, for I am looking forward
to an eternally blessed life with Jesus. <i>My faith
has done this for me: What has your way of thinking
done for you?</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, well, my good woman," the atheist said,
"please, understand me right&mdash;I have no desire to
disrupt your happiness, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, that wasn't the question at all," the old
woman interrupted&mdash;"don't beat about the bush,
but tell us: <i>What has your atheism done for you?</i>"</p>

<p>Once more the atheist tried to evade the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

vigorously that he felt it necessary to withdraw,
defeated by a woman who, during a life of hardships,
had experienced the power and the blessedness
of Christianity.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Ahlfeld in Leipsic once said in his
final address to a class of children about to be confirmed:</p>

<p>"Infidels will shake their heads at your faith.
They will speak of their unbelief as progress. They
will tell you that progress has been made in everything,
and they will ask you why you then should
abide by the ancient faith. Then you shall answer:
The ancient sun has shone for thousands of years,
and no one can give us one that is better. We make
no progress by rejecting it but by learning how to
make better use of its rays. Thus, also, with Christ.
He shines through all ages as the Sun of mankind.
He is the very same today and tomorrow and in all
infinity, and it is not progress to reject Him. We
must learn how to make increasingly better use of
the rays of His grace. That, children, <i>is our progress</i>!"</p>

<h2>AMERICA&mdash;YOU ARE THE HOPE OF
THE WORLD TODAY&mdash;&mdash;!</h2>

<div class='center'>May, 1919</div>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> 8, 36: If, therefore, the Son shall make
you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acts</span> 22, 28: But I was free born.</p></blockquote>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN Paul had been imprisoned at Jerusalem
the chief captain ordered that he is to be
scourged in an effort to make him tell the truth.
Paul then asks: "Is it lawful to scourge a man
that is a Roman?" The chief captain asks whether
he is a Roman, and Paul says that he is. The chief
captain goes on to say: "With a great sum obtained
I this freedom," but Paul answers: "I was free
born." It is a question of the right of free men in
ancient Rome.</div>

<p>Under the ancient Porcian law which was later
restored by the Sempronic, no Roman citizen might
be scourged, and anyone who violated the Roman
civil laws, was liable to a punishment which involved
the loss of property and life. Of this, we
realize how deeply treasured civil liberty and rights
were in ancient Rome. The right of free men
might not be assailed.</p>

<p>It is about this right that the chief captain says:
"With a great sum obtained I this freedom!" But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Paul answers frankly and proudly: "I was free
born!" <i>It is an heritage from my fathers.</i></p>

<p>Thus the young generation in America may say:
<i>We were born into civil liberty</i>. It is an heritage
from the fathers. We have obtained it at no expense
of our own. But the fathers of '76 bought
it with their blood. When they fought under the
command of George Washington, they endangered
their very lives in order to win this liberty. Many
sacrificed their lives. Indeed, it was dearly bought!
When the Declaration of Independence was signed,
Franklin exclaimed: "Now we all will have to
hang together, otherwise we will hang separately."</p>

<p>But in 1860 the Star Spangled Banner waved
above the heads of more slaves than there were
inhabitants in the country at the time of the signing
of the Declaration of Independence. So, for
the second time America was plunged into a struggle
for liberty for the purpose of making the Star
Spangled Banner the true flag of the free. The
spirit of '76 could not acquiesce in slavery. And
through Abraham Lincoln it entered into a covenant
with <i>the great, all-embracing and deeply sympathetic
heart</i>&mdash;a heart so great that it could enfold
the North and the South&mdash;so sympathetic that it
was able to embrace white and colored people alike,
friend as well as foe. This was the great heart
that led America through the days of the Civil
War&mdash;fortunately for this country.</p>

<p>It was this heart that beat in the breast of Lincoln
when he as a 22-year old man down in New
Orleans saw how human beings were sold in the
same way as we nowadays sell cattle. Man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
wife were sold to separate buyers and parted never
to meet again&mdash;parted while they wept as though
the heart should burst. Then young Lincoln raised
his hand toward heaven vowing: "By the eternal
God, if ever I get a chance to hit that thing, I will
strike it and strike it hard." This was the Lincoln
who led in the Civil War. The man with the
great heart was equipped as no one else to win the
victory, to <i>maintain the union of North and South
and to gain freedom for the Negroes</i>. It was he
who said, when victory was an accomplished fact,
that he would continue the fight for the rights of
man without hesitation, "with malice toward none,
with charity to all."</p>

<p>But since the days of the Civil War America has
gained a wealth which no other country has ever
possessed. You young people are born to claim that,
too.</p>

<p><i>Our youth was born to wealth and to inherit the
forefathers of '76 as well as Lincoln, the man with
the great heart.</i></p>

<p>It is, indeed, great to be born to all these things.
But it is not easy. It requires a strong and alert
youth to make the right use of such treasures.</p>

<p>Added to this it must be remembered that America
after the Civil War was reckoned with as one
of the Great Powers. When problems of world
significance were to be settled, the question was
asked: What does America say about it?</p>

<p>Came then the great world war. America stayed
out as long as possible. The world began to reckon
less with us than before. Germany even thought
she could sneer at us with impunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>How was that? Was it a matter of distance
only? No, in Germany the belief prevailed <i>that
the spirit of '76, and the heart of Lincoln's day had
died within the bosom of young America</i>. At all
events, it was not inclusive enough to span the
great ocean and to sympathize with those who were
suppressed and suffering yonder. It was with young
America as with the wild animals caught and put
into a cage: They are led into a life of ease and
indolence; they lose their strength, their elasticity
and their power of propagation. In brief: <i>Ease and
indolence kill them!</i></p>

<p>Similarly, it was thought <i>prosperity</i> had killed
the spirit of '76 and the all-embracing heart of Lincoln
in the youth of America, and under those circumstances
there could be no danger that American
youth would enter the great world war where prosperity
and all kinds of comfort and ease were to
be sacrificed and life itself be risked.</p>

<p>Miss Grace C. Bostwick writes in <i>The Pagan</i>:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
<i>O America!</i><br />
They said you were young and crude and extravagant,<br />
And that your women were too free and open;<br />
That your children had no respect for age;<br />
And that you gave no thought to the past.<br />
They said you had no artistic sense<br />
And accused you of setting up an altar<br />
To the almighty Dollar&mdash;&mdash;<br />
O America!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>And they smiled when your name was mentioned.<br />
But yesterday<br />
There marched an army down the street,<br />
An army of brave-eyed men with boyish mouths,<br />
Straight-backed and proud in their new-found mission&mdash;<br />
The saving of the world!<br />
And yesterday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. somewhere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at sea<br />
A white face floated<br />
With empty eyes upturned to an unseeing sky.<br />
And yesterday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a barren field .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a mere boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">fell from his perilous work on high&mdash;</span><br />
While great ships heavy with sustenance<br />
Plow stolidly through the deep .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
O America!<br />
You are the Hope of the World today.<br />
</div>

<p>Germany had made a miscalculation; the spirit
of '76 was not dead in young America, neither was
the great heart of Lincoln. Prosperity had not
been able to kill them. When the suppressed really
needed America, our youth heeded the summons.
With firm footsteps, with eyes afire, they went away
into the great fight. I do not know whether they
vowed as did the young Lincoln, but I do know
that when they arrived at the battlefield, they
struck, and struck hard&mdash;so hard, indeed, that the
tyrant succumbed. And well may we say about
that right of free men which was won by American
participation: <i>It was dearly bought by you&mdash;who
never came back</i>.</p>

<p>It is said that the French government in July,
1918, had decided to order the evacuation of Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
but when General Pershing heard this, he telegraphed
a request to postpone the carrying out of
the order until his soldiers had entered into active
fighting. Then came the turning point. Our soldiers
brought it about, and victory was won.</p>

<p>But a new element has entered into the history
of the war&mdash;into the relations among nations. It is
the word of Jesus: "Therefore all things whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye
even so to them." Never before has this maxim
been accepted as the <i>Golden Rule</i> governing international
relations. President Wilson has repeated
it time and again, and it characterized our participation
in the war, even to the extent that our country
has paid for the damages made to French soil when
our soldiers dug their trenches. And this was but
right. America did not enter the war with the
intention of conquering or destroying one hair-breadth
of ground. So we are justified in saying
to Germany: You must pay for what you have destroyed,
to the best of your ability.</p>

<p>"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them!" By this we have
arrived at something new. Our participation in the
war constituted a great sacrifice of lives and money
without any expectation of indemnity of any kind.
But in this we find something of the redemption
from the <i>thraldom of greediness</i>&mdash;something of that
freedom to which Jesus will guide mankind. But
that freedom is won only by the aid of the spirit
of the Lord. And it seems to me that the spirit
of '76 and the heart of Lincoln have entered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a covenant with, and have shown a willingness to
be guided by, the spirit of the Lord.</p>

<p><i>Where the youth of America marches forward
to fight in accordance with the spirit of '76 and with
the great heart of Lincoln, guided by the spirit of
the Lord, it is an unconquerable army and will
always carry home the victory.</i></p>

<p>With Lincoln we can say: Victory is won, but
the fight is to be continued without hesitation, with
malice toward none, with charity to all.</p>

<p>I believe that America is destined to lead the
nations of the world in the future, but if this is to
succeed rightly, then our youth must make it clear
to itself that it faces the choice between <i>the altar
of the living God and the altar of the almighty
Dollar.</i> <i>For which of these will you young people
spend your strength? At which of these altars will
you pray and praise?</i> The eyes of everyone look
toward America as never before: "O, America!
You are the Hope of the World today!" Is this
truth to remain? It depends on you, young men
and women&mdash;depends on your choice of altars.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a man who was permitted
to wish whatever he wanted, and his wish
would be granted. But he was to wish only once.
Finally he made up his mind to wish that everything
he touched would turn to gold. First he touched
the door post. It turned to gold. He rubbed his
hands delightedly: What a nice big piece of gold!
It certainly was fine that his wish was as sensible
as this! Then he started to wash himself, but the
water turned to gold. That wasn't quite as delightful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
but he let that pass. After that he sat down
to eat, but the food turned to gold. He then realized
that the fulfillment of his highest wish would
lead him into certain death.</p>

<p>Likewise there are people in America who wish
that everything they touch turn to gold. The result
of everything they do is to be converted into gold:
We name them profiteers. They kneel before the
shrine of the almighty Dollar. But this means certain
death to the spirit of '76 and to the deeply
sympathetic heart of Lincoln, and the spirit of the
Lord expires through this worship of gold. They
think of themselves only. They are enslaved by the
fetters of greediness. They refuse to do to others
what they wish others should do to them. Are they
to get the upper hand? It is for you, young people,
to answer! The future of America lies in your
hands. What is your choice?</p>

<p>Professor Georg Fr. Nicolai of the University
of Berlin during the war gave expression to thoughts
of such a nature that he was forced to flee from
Germany to Denmark. It was there that he in
October, 1918, wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"There are times in the history of mankind when
we dare not put new wine into old bottles (Mar.
2, 22). We require new wine, new bottles, new
thoughts and new men. In order to give the peoples
of the earth faith, an inner awakening is
required. The Bible speaks of it as repentance....
Less pathetically we moderns refer to it as
the new adjustment. But no matter what name we
bestow upon it, it stands to reason that without an
awakening no new life can be produced....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The process of dissolution is so far advanced that
today the Biblical word has become true: Only he
who giveth his life, shall keep it.... A new
spirit must be inculcated in the peoples."</p>

<p><i>A new spirit must be inculcated in the peoples!</i>
That is the decisive factor for the happiness and
the health of the nations in the future. Political
spirit of liberty is not enough. Inspired by that you
may fight and conquer and&mdash;set your foot upon the
neck of the foe. No, a new spirit is needed. It is
that spirit which, redeeming, speaks through the
words of the Lord: "Whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them!"
That's the task that confronts you young people. It
may not possess the tension and the excitement of
the battlefield&mdash;it may not, perhaps, let you directly
feel that you are taking part in the solution of the
great problems of the world's history&mdash;it is, nevertheless,
THE very greatest task of the world. Here
we must be impelled by the spirit of God.</p>

<p>It is related about Samson how "the spirit of the
Lord came mightily upon him." But while the
beginning was good, the end was sad, for at last
he was driven only by lust. Therefore he was of
little blessing. He ended by representing mere
brute force and no more.</p>

<p>I have seen the glow of the spirit in the eyes of
the young when they went to war. In the beginning
they were moved by the spirit of the Lord. Now
the task is to continue in that spirit and thus continuously
to remain "the Hope of the World"&mdash;not
to end in materialism and as representing no more
than brute force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>America is wealthy enough, strong enough, to
attain a leading position in the ranks of the nations&mdash;to
enjoy an age of greatness as did Germany.
But in that case the collapse is sure. It is but a
short distance ahead. We will have to face it&mdash;as
Germany now has faced defeat.</p>

<p>Germany had been saturated with Darwinism.
Looked at from one point of view, it is an emphasis
placed upon brute force and upon the survival of
the fittest. Added to this came the materialism
which laid stress upon the values of what was
materialistic and mechanical at the cost of the soul.
The nation grew great and strong. But man became
petty and insignificant. No nation has ever
possessed such a wonderful and perfect mechanical
development as that which Germany had reached
when the war broke out. On the strength of that,
the dominion of the world was to be won. But
here, too, the words of the Lord apply: "For what
is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul?" (Mat. 16, 26). What
profited it Germany that she possessed her soul-less
mechanical attainments, even though they were ever
so wonderful and marvelous? What would it have
profited Germany to have gained the whole world
when she would lose her soul thereby? No, then
the great defeat certainly was to be preferred.
Through that Germany may recover her lost soul.
If ever any new adjustment was needed, it is there.
A new spirit must be inculcated in the people.</p>

<p>But what would it profit America if she won the
rank of a leader among nations through her strength
and wealth? Nothing at all. The great collapse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
would be only a short distance ahead. Before or
later we would succumb to it.</p>

<p>Still I believe that America possesses the qualifications
for leadership as no other nation in history
does&mdash;the leadership of that new adjustment which
the world must needs experience if life shall ever
again become sufferable upon this old earth of ours.</p>

<p>Why is it that America has superior qualifications?
Has not England the very same qualifications?
Are not the English the great commercial
nation which embraces the earth with its countless
ships? Or France&mdash;that liberty-loving nation
with its technically wonderfully developed language?
Now when everything settles down again,
will not these nations be able to assume the leading
position in the history of the world just as well as
America?</p>

<p>No.&mdash;And I will attempt to explain why they
cannot.</p>

<p>America has been created through a mingling of
all the peoples of the world, as it were. It is true
that some claim all the rogues and scoundrels of
the Old World came over here&mdash;and some of them
undoubtedly did. But it is not they who have built
up America and made her great and strong. Nor
is it those people of whom it requires twelve to
make a dozen&mdash;for that species generally dies where
it was born.</p>

<p>No, they who built America were men and
women who possessed the great <i>daring</i> and that
<i>strength of the will</i> which were necessary in order
to carry them across great stretches of water and
land, to make them fell the vast forests and break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the prairie soil, and to build their homes in the
woods and upon the prairies. These are the people
who built America&mdash;who made the country great
and strong and wealthy.</p>

<p>Many have feared that the daring and the
strength of will of the fathers had died. The
younger generation had too markedly become a
<i>candy, kid-glove, silkstockinged youth</i>. But yonder
on the great battlefield it found an opportunity to
show that it still possessed the daring and the
strength of will of the fathers. Once General
Pershing had to retire his troops one mile. It was
reported to headquarters, and the reply came back:
"Push your men a little farther back and let them
rest!" But by that time General Pershing already
was preparing to storm forward again. And so
unexpectedly swift and vigorous was the attack that
not only was the lost mile regained, but one in addition.
It was the daring of the American soldiers
that won in this instance. And, speaking generally,
it must have been the <i>daring</i> and the <i>strength of
will</i> of the American soldier that conquered the
<i>mechanism</i> of the German army.</p>

<p>The daring and the strength of will of the fathers
still live on in the young generation: It is a contribution
from all the peoples of the earth which
no other individual nation can boast&mdash;and it is one
of these very qualifications which make it possible
for America to lead upon the great stage of history.</p>

<p>But, in this respect it is of still greater importance
that America by receiving this contribution
from all the peoples of the earth has developed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<i>deep-seated and sincere feeling of community</i> with
all nations. Through the Irishmen here, America
is in close contact with Ireland, through the Poles
with Poland, through the Bohemians with Bohemia,
through the Danes with Denmark, and so on. This
adds to the qualifications which fit America for
assuming the part of the leader in the progress of
the world, and is in itself a qualification which no
other country at any time has ever had, and which
no other country most likely will ever have at any
time in the future. There is no nation in the
world which has such a <i>vivid and natural consciousness
of community</i> with as many peoples as
has America. And this is of unprecedented importance.
For that nation which is to lead the world
during the period of <i>readjustment</i> which the world
so sorely needs, must do so, not through power and
wealth, but through a deep-seated sympathy and a
readiness and ability, born of that sympathy, to
lead the many nations forward to something better&mdash;to
a higher and nobler national life so that they
will strive to live according to the words of the
Lord: "Whatsoever ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them."</p>

<p>But America loses this unique qualification for
leadership among the nations, on the day when
the multitudinous languages spoken here die. Therefore,
the great question is whether or not progress
in this respect is to lead into that narrowmindedness
which kills the many tongues. Or, will the development
favor a retention of the native languages of
the various nationalities here together with English?
<i>English is the great common language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
America&mdash;the principal language which must be
learned by the immigrants.</i> This is so obviously
a matter of fact that it really should be unnecessary
to allude to it. But, in addition, every nationality
should be allowed to retain its native language in
order to ensure for America the preservation of that
deep-seated natural sympathy with the many peoples
created by God&mdash;"of one blood all nations of men."
The American nation is related to all other nations.
It therefore has the qualification for <i>understanding
them</i> and <i>for encouraging the feeling of brotherhood</i>
among them which no other nation ever has
had, and which any other individual nation most
likely never will have.</p>

<p>The history of the world is like one great and
magnificent epic. Each nation constitutes a song
in the poem. England has its own song&mdash;France
has its own, and so forth. America has its own
great hymn, but, in addition a large number of
little songs, each has its own particular rhythm
derived from the manifold living languages spoken
here, and they add <i>richness</i> and <i>volume</i> to the
mighty chorus.</p>

<p>Let me use another simile: We all know the
Mississippi River. It runs from a point 'way up
in the remote northwest, winds its way east and
south until finally it releases its immense masses
of water into the great sea. How does the river
get these immense masses of water? The answer
is that on its way it absorbs one little rivulet after
another. Humming and rippling from cheerful
little wells here and there they come, and every
little rivulet, no matter how pitifully small and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
insignificant it may look, helps the Mississippi to
become the great river which carries its tremendous
volume of water to the sea.</p>

<p>Likewise, the American language is the great
river which receives its cheerful additions from the
many smaller living languages. Each springs from
its own particular source, singing its own particular
tune, and each language makes its own little contribution
in order to make the American language
powerful and great and to give it that wonderful
volume which enables it to run into the great sea
of the life of nations carrying with it a blessing of
wealth like no other language. And the many
individual peoples will, when they hear the English
language spoken from America, feel that it comprises
such a strange richness and volume as they
are unable to find elsewhere. Indeed, it is almost
as though they would hear the American people
address them in their own respective language&mdash;that
"wherein they were born" (Acts 2, 9).</p>

<p><i>Ah, you young generation!</i> Behold this&mdash;and
understand it! You are born not merely into the
wealth of your land and to take up the heritage
of your fathers. But you are destined for <i>a glorious
future</i>, for a future achievement so great and magnificent
that no young generation in any other
country has ever seen the like.</p>

<p><i>You, young man, and you, young woman&mdash;you
have been chosen to draw the strength and vitality
of life from a multitude of small wells within your
own field and to derive such sustenance from them
that you can form your lives beautifully and
harmoniously. And you have been chosen, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
spirit of brotherhood, to lead such a current of pure
thoughts and elevated ideals to all the peoples of the
earth in such a manner as to cause them to wonderingly
ask: How is all this? We hear them speak
the American tongue, and yet it is as though we
hear them speak to us in our own language&mdash;in
that "wherein we were born."</i> It sounds just as
home-like and peculiarly attractive as our own&mdash;because
it has been enriched by many tongues. And
the vital richness and fulness which it carries to
them has gained from the fact that we here have
had such a multitude of wells to draw from.</p>

<p>Therefore we, who are older, bend our knees
and pray as did David (Ps. 144, 12): "That our
sons may be as plants grown up in their youth: that
our daughters may be as corner stones, polished
after the similitude of a palace!"</p>

<p>What we want&mdash;is this: Strong erect young men,
sons of America, who perceive, with the clearness
of the spirit, the problems of the future and who,
with the red blood of youth coursing in their veins
and the glow of enthusiasm lingering in their eyes,
will take up the task of solving them.</p>

<p>And, moreover: Pure and noble women: David
had been looking at the corner stones that were to
support that temple which was to be the tangible
expression of Israel's ideal life, that of community
with holy and just God: How beautiful they would
be when they were polished&mdash;and how strong! Indeed,
they were able to support that wonderful
temple which was to be built to the glory of God.
And then he has been thinking: O, Lord, give us
women like these corner stones! Pure, noble, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
strong women who can be the very foundation of
the home-life of our country&mdash;and carry it into the
community with God!</p>

<p>Paul the apostle writes in his epistle to the Philippians,
2, 5-11:</p>

<p>"Let this mind be in you, which was also in
Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God,
thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but
made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him
the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness
of men, and being found in fashion as a man,
He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto
death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God
hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name
which is above every name, that at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven,
and things in earth, and things under the earth;
and that every tongue should confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."</p>

<p>Jesus Christ won the name which is above every
name because He served mankind as no one else had
done, and gave His life for its sake. Thereby He
became the Saviour of men&mdash;their great leader who
can guide them into eternal life and blessedness.
Thereby He also became <i>the Lord</i> to the glory of
God the Father.</p>

<p>During the war America gave herself to the
service of mankind as did no other nation. Therefore
the suppressed looked to America quietly imploring
for aid, and therefore it might be said
truthfully, especially in 1918: "O, America, you
are the Hope of the World today!"</p>

<p>Now the question remains: Will America continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to be the great, unselfish servant among the
nations, above all others, leading them into the
riddance of the thraldom of greediness, guided by
the spirit of the Lord? Then&mdash;if she does&mdash;she
will win a name above the names of all other
nations, because she will be the great servant who
shows the way to the highest ideals&mdash;to the pure,
charitable and peaceful thoughts among nations
in that national and human brotherhood for which
God created them: Of one blood all nations of
men.</p>

<p>This I wish with all my heart. But it devolves
upon you, young people, to answer. It devolves
upon you to determine whether this will continue
to be true:</p>

<p>"<i>America! You are the Hope of the World
today!</i>"</p>

<p><i>God bless you, America!&mdash;God bless you with
all your homes and with all your youth!</i></p>
